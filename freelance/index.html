          <h1 id="freiberufler">Freiberufler</h1>
<p>We have collected frequently asked questions and answers from our chat room on how to become a Freiberufler. Someone will find it useful to collect questions from @ilya.n @wowa @Ghedeon.</p>

<h2 id="i-quit-my-job-and-decided-to-become-a-freiberufler-where-do-i-start">I quit my job and decided to become a Freiberufler, where do I start?</h2>
<p>(I’ve already gone and told Arbeitsamt that I’m unemployed or haven’t gone yet.)</p>

<p>The main thing is to understand what you want to do and how much you plan to get. You can look for a company while you’re thinking about it, find it to sign a contract and then go to the FA (step 1) - it takes 4 weeks. Preparing for the contract and looking for a customer are things you should also take officially as the beginning of your activity, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On March 1, you started looking for a contract, spent 1k on trips to Germany</li>
  <li>On March 10th, you found a contract, decided you could make 50k this year.</li>
  <li>On March 15, you signed a contract</li>
  <li>On March 20, you started working</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, if you submit the paper to the FA before March 28th, you can specify the start date of the activity on March 1st and the search costs (from March 1st to March 9th) can be deducted from the tax base. If you submit the paper after April 15, the FA in this example may be offended (signing a contract is always an activity)</p>

<p>Here is a lot of information on registration In finance, how to fill in the registration. I did it myself and used the video from [youTube] (http://www.internet-einkommen.net/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung). You can contact a berater.</p>

<p>Registration form [Fragebogen zur steuerlichen Erfassung] (https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/printout/034250.pdf)</p>

<h1 id="gewerbe-oder-freiberufler">Gewerbe oder Freiberufler</h1>

<p>The main difference between Gewerbe and Freiberufler in the types of activities and education of the entrepreneur who will receive income.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gewerbe</strong> - Revenue from the sale of products (e.g., trading on ebay, advertising revenue, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Freiberufler</strong> - consulting services to clients with specialized education.</p>

<p>Registration <code class="highlighter-rouge">Freiberufler</code> is as simple as possible - the questionnaire for registration is filled in and refers to the FA. After ~5 weeks you will receive the cherished steueridentifikationsnummer and can bill customers.</p>

<p>To register <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gewerbe</code> you need to go to the City Hall and fill out the registration application, pay the fee, and then give the completed questionnaire to the FA.</p>

<p>Unlike Freiberufler, Guewerbe pays additional tax.</p>

<h2 id="kleinunternehmer">Kleinunternehmer</h2>

<p>Provided that the income from business activities does not exceed the threshold of ~17k€ in the first year and ~50k€ in the following year, 
you can choose a simplified reporting option and the option not to submit a monthly VAT report to the FA.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Finanzamt counts the calendar year. If you register with Kleinunternehmer in December, your income for the year cannot exceed 17500/12=1458 Eur. Take this into account when planning.</p>

<p>The type of registration <code class="highlighter-rouge">Freiberufler</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Gewerbe</code> does not affect the status of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Kleinunternehmer</code>.</p>

<h1 id="pensions">Pensions</h1>

<p>If you don’t owe the pension money, you don’t have to notify me if you have one customer so far, I would go to the pension office and talk about rule 5/6 (you don’t want it).</p>

<p>Attention! Knowing all the things about who you have to do what is your responsibility if, for example, tomorrow SPD wins the election and passes the law that you have to pay the pension, then you have to decide for yourself.</p>

<p>Specifically, the pension payment deadline is March of the following year.</p>

<h2 id="health-insurance">Health insurance</h2>
<p>The most correct option is to have insurance in place and stay on it.
Insurance has no right to kick you out. If you stay insured and your wife is unemployed, she does not need to pay extra if she has worked, she will pay the same amount of insurance as before.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public, 15.7%.</li>
  <li>Private. About 300Eur. Depending on the state of health and age.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are alone, you will probably want to get out of your insurance as soon as possible. Calculator for [TK] (https://www.tk.de/tk/versicherung-und-beitraege/beitragsrechner/selbststaendige/208528). It can easily reach 770 per month.</p>

<h2 id="tax-class">Tax class</h2>
<p>The tax class works on the same principle
If you have received more of it and now as a selbstständig you also plan to receive more of it, you should leave the tax class as it is, if you are not scrapped, you can look for private insurance.</p>

<p>The main problem with insurance is that it will take at least 400 euros a month
it can’t be bypassed until you’re registered as a freiberuflich.
and then if you get a lot of money, you’re still gonna have to pay up to 800 a month</p>

<h1 id="arbeitsamt">Arbeitsamt</h1>
<p>I’ve already gone and told the Arbatesamt I’m unemployed.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a relationship with them, it’s a deep parallel to them,
if there is, and they’re paying you money, we should go talk about Existenzgründer.
The opportunity to continue receiving Arbeitslosgeld until you start your business.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-of-contracts">Conclusion of contracts.</h2>
<p>Let’s say I was offered a contract by a company. What should I pay attention to and can I conclude a contract without having anything (registration with Finanzamt, etc.)?</p>

<p>We have freedom - yes, you can
That you can’t just bill and get paid.
You have to specify the tax number (the local number that changes when you move)
(It is believed that it is possible to specify there already existing personal number (Steuer ID, which you received after registration in the FA. Not to be confused with the Identifikationsnummer, which is the default for everyone.) If you filed a declaration last year, but I wouldn’t)</p>

<p>That’s why it is necessary to plan the letter/goods to FA two weeks before the invoice is issued
At this point - see above - you have to understand how much money you plan to get
This amount should be indicated in the form and based on it check the box saying that you will or will not take VAT (I recommend to make IstVersteurung).
Option 3:
1) If you exceed 17.5k in the first year - you must collect VAT
2) you don’t have to and don’t collect VAT
3) you don’t have to, but you voluntarily collect VAT - it’s a little bit more profitable than option 2 on the cache
When you started collecting VAT, you have to collect it and report it every month.</p>

<h2 id="the-bank">The bank</h2>
<p>Bank - It is desirable to have a separate account, it will be much easier to report to the tax authorities. You can view services such as http://kontist.com (Not any separate service. Banks provide special accounts for doing business. Tariff schedules and services there are also different.)</p>
