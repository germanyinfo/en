          <h1 id="insurance">Insurance</h1>

<h4 id="what-kinds-of-insurance-do-you-get">What kinds of insurance do you get?</h4>

<p><strong>Obligatory for all who live in Germany:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Krankenversicherung = KV = Health insurance</li>
  <li>Pflegeversicherung = PV = old age insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Pflegeversicherung goes to the same company but in a separate payment (2-3% of income).</p>

<p>In addition to the payments described above, **automatically deducted from the employee’s salary</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rentenversicherung = RV = Pension Insurance</li>
  <li>Arbeitslosenversicherung = AV = ALG I = Unemployment insurance</li>
  <li>Unfallversicherung = UV = Accident insurance at work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other insurances that can be purchased by yourself:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kfz-Haftpflichtversicherung = compulsory car insurance if the car is out of rooms</li>
  <li>[Privathaftpflicht] (https://www.check24.de/privathaftpflicht/) - third party liability insurance</li>
  <li>[Hausratversicherung] (https://www.check24.de/hausratversicherung/) - damage from fire, flooding, thieves, etc.</li>
  <li>[Rechtsschutzversicherung] (https://www.check24.de/rechtsschutzversicherung/) - Lawyer’s insurance</li>
  <li>[Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung] (https://www.check24.de/berufsunfaehigkeitsversicherung/) - Occupational disability insurance</li>
  <li>Protect the tenant from possible problems with the landlord:
    <ul>
      <li>http://www.berliner-mieterschutzverein.de/mitgliedschaft/</li>
      <li>Sync by honeybunny https://www.mieterschutzbund.de/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>[Zahnzusatz-Versicherung] (https://www.check24.de/zahnzusatzversicherung/) - Dental insurance</li>
</ul>

<p>It is highly recommended to take out Privathaftpflichtversicherung - personal liability insurance against unintentional damage to third parties - if, for example, you have broken a friend’s laptop or ridden a bicycle and hit someone else’s car.</p>

<p>Some Landlords require a Privathaftpflichtversicherung and Hausratversicherung from the tenant.</p>

<p>All other insurances are required depending on the lifestyle, risks and health conditions, as well as the availability of pets</p>

<p>All insurances should be carefully read the terms and conditions, plus understand that such contracts in Germany are usually eternal, that is, they will be extended until obviously will not be made Kündigung (usually in 3 months).</p>

<h4 id="health-insurance">Health insurance</h4>

<p>All German residents are required to have health insurance that meets German standards. These standards are not satisfied with travel insurance, which, if a person broke his leg, pay for his or her way home to the hospital.</p>

<p>There are two types of health insurance, GKV and PKV. Most people are required to be in the GKV system, but some people are allowed to switch to the PKV system.</p>

<p>In the GKV (“gesetzliche” = “legal”, socialism) you pay according to your possibilities (a certain percentage of your income) and get it according to your needs (there is no money involved in going to the doctor). If you have a lot of money (salary &gt; Versicherungspflichtgrenze = 59,400.00 € in 2018), the state allows you to switch to the PKV system. In the PKV system (private, private, capitalism) you pay according to the actuarial risk calculated by the company, and the doctors issue invoices, which have to be paid for themselves and then receive the insurance money to the account. In the PKV, you can play with a franchise, partial coverage (e.g., 90%), or various buns (“chief physician’s service”).</p>

<p>We could discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the GKV and PKV here, but practically private insurance companies will not take a person who hasn’t treated all his diseases in Germany for a couple of years. In addition, they will ask for a medical examination and will think for a few months. So if you have just arrived in Germany, you will only be affected by the GKV system.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, you need to know about the existence of the PKV system, for example, because the person who gets more than the specified limit in the documents is marked as freiwillig versichert (and if less, pflichtversichert). This does not mean that you can simply refuse insurance or not pay - only that you can try to switch to the PKV system if you wish. This is a separate and large topic.</p>

<h4 id="practical-steps-for-newcomers">Practical steps for newcomers</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Before or after arrival (but it is better before the nervous HR starts running in circles and saying that he can’t pay his salary) you should choose one of the insurance companies GKV and write to them about yourself and your favorite family members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the job will be paid from the first day of work, the insurance will also be valid from that time, even if the process of joining will be delayed (moreover, the insurance is obliged to accept the person and pay the post fact that he has already been to the doctor during this period).</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-insurance-companies-in-the-gkv-system">What is the difference between insurance companies in the GKV system?</h4>

<p>By law, they take almost the same money: 14.6 + (about 1)% = X% of (income up to a certain limit) and provide almost the same services. A small difference can be in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Payments for homeopathy, acupuncture, etc.</li>
  <li>Healthy lifestyle bonuses, e.g. 100 euros per year</li>
  <li>Paying for health courses, e.g. 200 euros per year</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-choose-an-insurance-company-in-the-gkv-system">How to choose an insurance company in the GKV system?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[Techniker Krankenkasse, TK] (https://tk.de) have a reputation for being the most scientific, but this reputation is slightly exaggerated, for example [they were among the first to pay for homeopathy] (http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/kosten-nutzen-rechnung-krankenkassen-kaempfen-fuer-homoeopathie-a-706336.html)</li>
  <li>[AOK] (https://aok.de) is a historical local cash register, founded in 1884 as a cash register, which took all (at the time when most of it was organized by professions)</li>
  <li>there’s actually a lot of them, it’s better to look at check24</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t like the company, you can change it in 18 months.</p>

<h4 id="insurance-in-gkv-of-people-without-work">Insurance in GKV of people without work</h4>

<p>Typical cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the spouse/child of the person being paid into the system without their own income: since X% of 0 = 0, free Mitversicherung (with some small amount of income equated to 0)</li>
  <li>was an employee, but became unemployed without income: it is necessary to pay a small amount of money, depending on the situation it is possible that the first month is not necessary to pay</li>
  <li>officially receives ALG I/II: insurance is paid as part of the benefit</li>
  <li>Self-employed, lives on interest from shares, won the lottery, other income: you have to pay X% on your own</li>
  <li>you have moved from the EU country to look for a job and have been in public insurance before: the previous insurance is valid or the GKV takes care of it for a small sum of money</li>
  <li>you did not move from the EU to look for a job: the consulate had to explain the topic in detail, up to 6 months is enough travel insurance (which does not cover everything), more than 6 months will not be allowed to live</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="does-my-health-insurance-work-outside-germany">Does my health insurance work outside Germany?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>in the EU?
In most cases, yes, but it is better to check it before you travel by typing in the search engine “EHIC name of the EU country”. It does not depend on the insurance company.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>outside the EU? 
No, but there are exceptions that depend on the insurance company. For example, TK health insurance covers medical expenses when travelling to [Turkey or Tunisia] (https://www.tk.de/tk/beratung/schutz-im-ausland/ausserhalb-euroas/348470).</p>

<h4 id="what-is-rechtsschutzversicherung-and-whats-it-for">What is Rechtsschutzversicherung and what’s it for?</h4>
<p>Lawyer’s insurance - Rechtsschutzversicherung, has a number of essential nuances and very ambiguous reviews. Basically, for the decision of questions with the employer, landlord or in case of an accident. Insurance coverage is not provided to the client in case of intentional violation of the law. A criminal offence has been committed and the accused urgently needs legal protection. At first glance, the crime is committed not intentionally, but because of negligence. The defendant used the services of a lawyer at the expense of insurance, but in the process of conducting the case, the prosecutor presents indisputable evidence of intentionality of the crime committed, and then the judge makes the appropriate decision. From that moment on, the insurance cover is terminated and the accused is obliged to reimburse the insurance company for all expenses incurred.</p>
