<h2 id="job-search-experience">Job search experience</h2>

<h4 id="recruiters">Recruiters</h4>

<p>####### Searching for work
########## For</p>
<ul>
  <li>the recruiter takes care of the processing of the initial data (can help to create a Lebenslauf) and the first communication. In addition, good recruiters will always invite you to talk in person to make sure you are sane and to practice your interview.</li>
  <li>This is free of charge and only takes up your time. So there is no risk for you, and you can drop an interesting offer.</li>
  <li>Small firms do not have HR and managers or leaders are looking for employees. Often they just look for employees in xing-es or other social networks.</li>
  <li>As a rule, a recruiter does not work with companies that are not ready to pay for his services. So there is no need to worry about the cost to the employer or the bureaucracy, he has already agreed to it.</li>
  <li>In any case, you will be invited to a personal interview, so always review your position requirements yourself. Sometimes a recruiter may miss key points (Java or Javascript)</li>
</ul>

<p>########## Against</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most of them look through the same job sites and then send you a job offer to introduce you to the company.</li>
  <li>Someone will think it’s a disadvantage that an employee can’t go to a linkedin and look for a job by himself.</li>
  <li>reputational risks. A recruiter, in order to interest the employer, can greatly embellish the candidate, as a result of which the gap between reality can increase significantly.</li>
  <li>There are recruiters who publish very unrealistic vacancies, and then, when you write to them, they start offering something else.</li>
  <li>Companies sit their HR’s, of course it is beneficial for them to present the closing of the position as their own merit, because it is their direct responsibility. An HR who closes a position completely by himself raises less questions about his usefulness than a candidate can find only through an intermediary.</li>
  <li>Recruiters most likely increase the legal entropy of companies, not all of them are eager to conduct legal expertise of additional contracts with recruiters, and to sign that no one will take responsibility either. This point is questionable, as to who has settled through recruiters, will bring clarity.</li>
</ul>

<p>####### Salary expectations
########## For</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the area of healthy eating, you say your expectations. The recruiter may advise you above or below, but he or she will give your wish to the client. (You don’t have to tell the truth, nobody checks. The last two works I have done are waiting for +10-15k or said that it makes sense to change if there is more than X)</li>
</ul>

  <li>Recruiters receive remuneration depending on the salary of the future employee. As a result, some of them persuade you to lower your salary expectations in order to increase your chances of getting a job and getting a reward, while others, on the contrary, overstate your expectations in order to increase your reward. In case of understatement the company will naturally have a question: either the person has greatly embellished, or does not know how to assess himself. All this does not add points to your candidacy. In case of overestimation, the company will naturally prefer to hire a person for whom there is no need to pay the recruiters, and who does not have overestimation of salary expectations. The percentage of refusals with recruiters will be higher.</li>

<h2 id="working-in-germany-without-higher-education">Working in Germany without higher education</h2>

<p>It is possible to find a job in Germany without a university degree. However, it is not possible to get a Blue Card without higher education. To obtain a work permit for people without higher education, you must obtain a so-called German national visa type D. The process of obtaining this visa without the Blue Card is, on average, more complicated and time-consuming than the same process for professionals with higher education who apply for the Blue Card, and can take a total of at least two months. The German authorities are rumoured to be considering a law that would replace the mandatory requirement for higher education with a 5-year work experience in the relevant field, but from personal experience in March 2015 (Russian specialist) and April 2016 (Brazilian specialist), the actual requirement for the Blue Card is higher education.</p>

<p>According to unverified data, German companies usually try to avoid candidates without higher education precisely because of the increased complexity of the process and take up employment of such candidates only if the candidates are really of particular value to them (a real example: 2 specialists without higher education in a company with 200 employees). In addition, the company’s willingness to employ candidates without higher education may depend on the company’s existing experience with such employment. If this process is established, the candidate will have to do almost nothing, because all instructions will be provided by the company, otherwise the candidate and the company will get this experience together with the German authorities and Russian/Ukrainian embassies.</p>

<p>There is an organization [Berlin Partner] (http://www.berlin-partner.de/en/our-services/talent-services/), which helps companies with employment of foreign specialists. If the company cooperates with the Berlin Partner, the patronage of the Berlin Partner in the case of a candidate without higher education significantly increases the probability that the visa will be issued to him.</p>

<p>After receiving the offer from a German company, among the documents for a visa, the candidate without higher education, except for the offer itself, it is desirable to have the following documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The so-called “motivational” letter from the company, in which it is written that the company knows that the candidate has no higher education, but that, despite this, the candidate is very, very valuable to the company as a potential employee.</li>
  <li>Motivation letter from Berlin Partner, which also states that the employee is very valuable for the German economy, despite his lack of higher education.</li>
  <li>Various documents that confirm the solidity of the company itself, its importance for the German economy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personal experience (spring 2015):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The process took 6 months: from obtaining the offer to going to work. In my case, the company did not have the experience of employing foreign specialists without higher education, so it took the first month and a half out of six months for the company to make a series of enquiries to the German authorities as to whether such employment was possible and the subsequent expectations of answers. The final answer did not say yes or no: “You should apply for a Type D national visa in your country and wait for an answer about the possibility of issuing a postal certificate from the German embassy or consulate in your country.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>All documents have been submitted, including motivation letters from the company and Berlin Partner. We had to wait two and a half months out of the two promised. When it became clear that something was going wrong, because there was no positive or negative answer, the company contacted the German authorities by phone and found out that my documents were stashed in a stack of dubious candidates, which was not disassembled in time. After that, I had to wait about a month and a half more, and finally, the positive answer came. My case was obviously exceptional, as the deadline was delayed due to some bureaucratic delay, but it was not obvious at the time of waiting and gave rise to a lot of worries and doubts about the possibility of successful completion of this enterprise.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>P.S. I only met one Brazilian colleague in the company who had no higher education, but I do not conclude that the case of a specialist without higher education is extremely rare. Later, when I was already in Germany, when I had the opportunity to interview other candidates, the first question my HR colleagues asked me about them was, “Does this candidate have a higher education?” and when I asked them why they were interested, they said that it was much easier for them to work with candidates with a higher education.</p>

<p>From personal experience (autumn 2018):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Introduction: The company is American, so all correspondence is in English and without problems. The company has extensive experience in working with foreigners and has dedicated people for this purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a paragraph about 5 years of experience as a substitute for HE - http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aufenthg_2004/__19a.html
But the relocation specialist said she couldn’t use it. You can try it on the spot (in Germany) (change your work visa to Blue Card).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the Blue Card, I did not have a Blue Card, so we decided to make a national work visa.
The additional documents are “approval from Federal Employment Agency” - “ANTRAG AUF ERLAUBNIS EINER BESCHÄFTIGUNG (unselbstständige Erwerbstätigkeit), die der Zustimmung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit bedarf”. This took 2.5 weeks (plus a week by mail), during which time I was able to translate all the necessary documents. The document is, as I understand it, important.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Served in Minsk. The visa was ready in less than a week. There was no interview with the consul or request for additional documents.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The process took 1.5 months from the moment of consent to the offer to the visa in the passport.</p>

<h2 id="dismissal">Dismissal</h2>

<h4 id="nuances-notice-period">Nuances notice period</h4>
<p>Generally, German contracts require a three-month notice period. But in addition, this period starts at the beginning of the calendar month. That is, let’s say, there is no difference, you wrote a letter of resignation on December 2 or December 29. Three months will start counting down on January 1 in both cases. Accordingly, it is important to choose the time when to start looking for a job. Your resume is usually accompanied by your salary expectations and the date on which you can start working. If you don’t want to take risks and find a job first, and then quit, you can get into a situation where you wrote to the company on January 20th that you can go to work in early May, while an interview was scheduled, while it was held, now waiting for a decision and a possible offer, but approaching the end of the month, and you either write a letter of resignation and take on additional risks, or write to the company that your possible date of employment shifts, which may cause rejection.
In addition to this, there may be nuances with the confirmation of the application for dismissal. If you submit it, say, on the 29th of the day, and send confirmation can already in the next month, which, accordingly, can also violate your plans, not the fact that the countdown will start from the date when you signed the application, and not when it was signed by a responsible person. That is, you may find yourself in a situation where you have signed a new contract on a certain date, and can not fulfill it due to obligations to the current contract.</p>

<h5 id="arbeitslosengeld-alg">Arbeitslosengeld (ALG)</h5>
<p>If you do not wish to be dismissed, you will be given a termination letter stating the date of the last working day.
Once you have received the letter, you can register with Arbeitsagentur to apply for benefits.
This is required:
1) The letter of termination itself
2) “Residence”, Meldebescheinigung
3) Passport and residence permit, e.g. Bluecard
4) Have more than 1 year of work experience in Germany
5) The possibility of explaining oneself in German, as this agency refuses to speak English flatly. Or call someone who can, with himself.
Further in agency will explain what to do, will give papers on filling in, the login-password to a personal office.
An important point is that you will receive the Arbeitsbescheinigung - a certificate of where you worked, how much you worked and with what salary. The certificate must be from all the jobs in the last three years. You can get it by contacting the companies where you worked.
Usually HR doesn’t prioritize these papers too much, and you can wait 1 to 3 weeks for them.
As long as these documents are not uploaded to Arbeitsagentur portal at least, the allowance will not be paid, although the days you have spent without work and will be counted and paid.
The amount of the allowance is about 60% of your net salary and the social and insurance contributions for you will be paid in the same way as the employer did.</p>
