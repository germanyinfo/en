<p>The list of schools is not complete at all, look for Google for your city.</p>

<h4 id="all-over-germany-including-berlin">All over Germany (including Berlin)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Berlitz http://www.berlitz.de/en/ Some of the best courses, but at the same time one of the most expensive, about 700€ per block.</li>
  <li>Goethe Institut https://www.goethe.de/ins/de/en/kur.html Institute responsible for German language distribution in the world. The price is about 600€ per block.</li>
  <li>Deutsche Akademie http://www.deutschakademie.de/, 225 € per block</li>
  <li>VHS (Volkshochschule) - almost every city has its own website (http://www.berlin.de/vhs/, https://www.vhs.frankfurt.de). Small towns offer A1-B1 courses, rarely a B2 course. In large cities there are also B2, C1 - … There are intensive courses - 4 times a week, in the morning or in the evening. The price is about 150€ per block.</li>
  <li>Inlingua https://www.inlingua.de/en/, a global network of schools all over the world, many languages. Quality aids, good teachers and motivated groups.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="only-berlin">Only Berlin</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Kapitel Zwei http://kapitel-zwei.de/, 222 € per block</li>

  <li>Logo! http://www.logosprachenschule.de/</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn the language as quickly as possible, it is better to study the language intensively and in small groups. Often, even in small groups there is a “brake”, and if the teacher retells the material to him again, you will waste your time. It is better to change the group or school.
Resisting the system is usually meaningless, often teachers are not inclined to change anything, and they are not going to get involved. But you can still get something for yourself as a compensation.</p>

<p>As practice shows, it all depends on the specific teacher and the group of students who will study with you.
Prices for intensity can vary very much, and the price is not an indicator of quality.</p>

<p>There are a lot of schools, and if you don’t like the school, change it. To avoid spending money on books every time, you can often rent them directly from the school.</p>

<h4 id="integration-courses-from-bamf-ministry-of-refugees-and-displaced-persons">Integration courses from BAMF (Ministry of Refugees and Displaced Persons)</h4>
<p>Previously, there was a practice of sending newcomers to compulsory or voluntary integration courses. The current practice is to send newcomers to compulsory or voluntary integration courses.

<p>If you successfully pass the exam after the B1 course, you can request a refund of 50% of your tuition fees,

Intensity A2-B1. Groups may not gain or assemble from what is available, respectively, in group B1 you can gain mixed A2-B1 levels.
The teaching staff is not permanent, if the memory does not change, they have only a couple of teachers on the contract, all the other temporary and changing.
If you get a “brake” in the group, you will all be braking together, and while he is told the things that he was supposed to learn at A1, everyone is waiting, and then part of the new material is skipped, because you have to keep up and go on schedule (but again, depends on the teacher).
In general, the courses are not expensive, you can try, if you like and the group will be good, study.
The main influx of students there in the summer. The main contingent of the school is students with all the ensuing ones.</p>

390 euros per month. Intensity B1-B2.1. Also in groups are mixed different levels. Some may read, others may not (and this is on B2).
The payment policy is not very convenient: the more you take, the cheaper the cost of the month, but it may happen that the students in the group will change and you will not want to study there anymore.
As in previous schools, the discipline is weak. Few people are preparing at home, so part of the time is wasted: checking homework and repeating the material. Some of the people in the group left Kapitel Zwei.</p>

<h3 id="kapitel-zwei">Kapitel Zwei</h3>

<p>220 euros per month. Intensity B1-B2.1. While there was a strong group, there was about. There was a teacher who led very well and clearly: did not wait for anyone, the material was read completely, the late did not wait. But the group quickly broke up (after the NG). The teacher changed and they started to get stupid. Like the previous schools, the same weak discipline, they walk - do not walk, are late, a couple of times someone even dragged a child.
When asked why we were waiting for students who were always late, the teacher waved only in the air - it is clear that he was tired of it, but he did not want to read the material to one person. However, it is worth mentioning that after such indignation they allowed to attend free conversation courses (as compensation). In the groups, some of them are poorly read, and the wife had questions: did they have any tests before the recruitment process?</p>

<p>To get rid of the “brakes”, we switched to C1 intensive. Now everything is fine: people talk well, are not late for classes, they prepare for classes. You can see that there are only those who have specific goals, and they are interested in the results.
The effectiveness of training is clearly higher when a similar group is being recruited.</p>

<p>The school also has a Telk exam preparation course + an opportunity to take the exam. The school’s curriculum itself intersects with the exam material.</p>

<p>Winter 2016-107
I went only in the evening, the groups are large, most of them are engaged because they were obliged to do it, the appropriate attitude to the lessons (the main thing is to come to check in), before the teachers were German, the latter were already Poles and Vietnamese, but cheaper you will not find anything. Contingent Syria, Afghanistan, those who are paid by the state. Neukölln seems to have a school where classes are only for women, such as Muslim women, who for various reasons cannot study in the same group as men. I went to Lichtenberg, which is a Vietnamese district, but the last time a Vietnamese man was only one, one girl from Kenya, but she quickly gave up. Here are the names of some of my classmates: Muhammad, Izmail, Noor, Halim, Hamid, Ali, Mustafa. I wrote about large groups there, it’s usually before B1 and usually at the beginning of the course, i.e. they recruit 15-18 people, by the middle of the course there are 9 people left, by the end of 6, and given that the courses are evening and the mark about their attendance takes place in the middle of the break, the part of the course leaves just after the mark, in the end up to the end of 3-4 people, in principle it’s comfortable, if you’re stubborn. It’s a bad thing that they walk through it once and then they let the material through in the end some trampling on the spot. By the way, there is a school at Baumschulenweg, I was there somehow, but they did not have evening courses then. In fact, no one wants to work with B1, it’s easier for teachers to work with A1, those who teach A1 and can’t really ask, and then come nerds like me on B1 and start to bake, and what differs schneiden from zuschneiden or anschalten from einschalten, and they can’t explain to Poles themselves.</p>
