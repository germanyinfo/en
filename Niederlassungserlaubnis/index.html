          <h2 id="what-is-niederlassungserlaubnis">What is Niederlassungserlaubnis?</h2>
<p>A permanent residence permit (Niederlassungserlaubnis, permanent residence permit) is a permit that allows non-European Union (EU) citizens to live and work freely in Germany. It is also known as unbefristete Aufenthaltserlaubnis - an unlimited residence permit. You can get it after five years of stay in Germany with a D visa. Holders of Blau Karte can receive a B1 language certificate after 21 months or an A1 language certificate after 33 months. Working and living in the EU outside of Germany is not permitted, but it is possible to be absent from Germany for up to six months with prior agreement with the ABH.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-daueraufenthalt-eu">What is Daueraufenthalt-EU?</h2>
<p>A permanent residence permit in the EU (Daueraufenthalt-EU, European permanent residence permit) is a broader permit for residence and work, but already in the entire EU. It is issued after 5 years of contributions to the German pension fund, it is also unlimited, it allows absence from Germany for up to 11 months if there is a proven need (e.g. business trip). Read more about the list of required documents [here] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324281/pdf/)</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-blaue-karte-and-niederlassungserlaubnis">What’s the difference between Blaue Karte and Niederlassungserlaubnis?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Unlike Blaue Karte, Niederlassungserlaubnis does not impose restrictions on employment. You can work as an employee, a freelancer, or you can not work, but live on savings. The requirement of Blaue Karte is a permanent place of work. To search for a new job - from 3 to 6 months.</li>
  <li>Allowed absence period in Germany for Niederlassungserlaubnis is 6 months, which can be extended by contacting [ABH] (ABH.md).</li>
  <li>If you move to another EU country, you need to apply to your local Blaue Karte locally, the exchange is not always possible, because each EU country has its own Blaue Karte requirements. With Niederlassungserlaubnis, you will have to go back to your home country and apply from there, but it will not prevent you from checking with the migration authority of the receiving country.</li>

<p>Reference from the pension fund is made [by term] (https://www.eservice-drv.de/eTermin/dsire/step0.jsp) or simply by visiting any branch.
It is also available free of charge by post ([service page] (https://www.eservice-drv.de/SelfServiceWeb/)).
IMPORTANT: Ask your employer what information about your pension contributions has been sent to the pension fund. My employer sends it once a year, in January - for the previous year.</p>

<p>I don’t want to do it again, I did it all as it says below. I will specify only features.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have been working on the Blue Card in Berlin for more than 21 months and have passed the B1 exam.
Recently I changed my job, I’m still on probation, but apparently it doesn’t matter.
I sent all the documents as a scan to the post office at the end of March. 
I received a letter with the date of my visit to Ausländerbehörde at the end of May.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arbeitgeberbescheinigung had to do it twice when sending the docks and bring the fresh one to the term.
If some documents are missing, they write letters by email, but send an invitation to Ausländerbehörde by regular mail.</li>
  </ul>

A certificate of payment to the pension fund (Rentenversicherungslauf) is obtained in Berlin through the SchnellService [here] (https://goo.gl/maps/V9qFQ8U7APm), go to the counter at the number, then go to the SchnellService
Since it was November, the data in the pension only for January, so attached all pay slips from the beginning of the year</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We immediately received a letter saying that we accepted and asked not to worry anymore - due to the increased load the processing will take up to 3 months.</p>

  <p>On January 15, I was running out of Blaue Karte, so at the end of November I made another term for [extension of Blaue Karte] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324659/en/), at the same time asking through [contact form] (http://www.berlin.de/labo/willkommen-in-berlin/service/business-immigration-service/formular.309589.php) on the website about the list of documents required for extension. In response, the following list was sent promptly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Work contract</li>
    <li>Confirmation from the employer</li>
    <li>The last three pay slips
“ Biometric Photo, 35x45</li>
  </ul>

  <p>On January 15 came to extend Blaue Karte, an employee asked where the language certificate is, I said that after 33 months only A1, and no one gives it, she asked about the photo, I gave it to her. All communication was in German, so the ABH employee gave me a token card for payment and offered to pay 69 euros at once, explaining that I will be issued with Niederlassungserlaubnis. I went to the second floor, paid with an EC-card. I was summoned to the office and presented with a passport with glued permanent residence permit and a mark that I owned Blaue Karte. Thus, the process took 2 months.</p>

  <p>Sent two packets of documents on the 18th: one by simple mail, the other by email.
On the 21st I was replied to my email and told that they couldn’t open the zip archive for security reasons and asked me to use PDF, which I did.
On the 24th we had a term in ABH: my wife needed to renew the visa. They told us that they could only extend by a year, as my visa expires in a year.
We told the employee that I was in the process of obtaining a NE. To which she replied: Come and renew again as soon as you get the NE.
With these words, we were asked to wait. In ~20 minutes we were called again and asked for my passport, blue card and appendix, and a photo.
To the surprised glances she said that I will now be issued NE, and my wife will be extended visa for three years. I was asked to wait again.
They called me in ~30 minutes. Everyone was glued new visas into the passport. I’m NE, my wife is three years old, and my child is under 16 years old.
Thus, the process took me 6 days.</p>

  <li>13.07 answered the question on one of the attachments from the personal email of the ABBH employee. Thus, I immediately had an email from an employee who is considering my case
    <blockquote>
      <p>9.08 wrote to the employee whether everything is ok with the documents and whether there is anything else to be done. She answered the next day, all right, expect
6.09 was on an ABH term on a different subject, and she also asked me how my papers were doing. An ABH employee sadly showed me a pocketbook with a list of people who had applied for NOT and said that now only the June ones are being considered. At the same time, she said that in 2016, there should be pension statements instead of paisley.
I went to the pension office on 26.09, they certainly don’t have any data for this year, they will be in February next year</p>

  </li>
  <li>26.09 wrote to the contact form on the ABH website with a polite question about the status of my case</li>
  <li>27.09 a letter from the personal email of an ABH employee with the term “NOT at 11.10” came in. The term should have been updated with an employer’s certificate, bk and passport (no paisley).</li>
  <li>11.10 have made the passport-not in the passport :slightly_smiling_face:</li>

    <li>Documents could not be sent by mail, and the answer was that everything ok with the documents came by email before the paper letter reached the ABH.</li>
    <li>They seem to read the appeals through the contact form. They don’t respond to them, but apparently this has stimulated my Beratorin to accelerate. Kicking them in person or by email is not particularly effective</li>
    <li>To receive NE came with a new foreign passport (not the one that was in the package of documents for filing), there were no questions, glued immediately there</li>
    <li>Blue Card not left. I asked if it was possible that an Ausländerbehörde employee said that two Auftenhaltstitels could not have at the same time. This is not the case, there is a court decision and precedents for obtaining a NE in addition to the Blue Card</li>

    <li>Submitted after 21 months in Germany, 5 August 2016. I arrived on 25 October 2014. I sent an email saying that I am 21 months old and I want NE. I was told in the mail that they had accepted my application (a regular email was right for them) and that they would contact me when the time came. They didn’t ask for any documents, just to wait.</li>
    <li>I had to wait for a real long time (3+ months), I wrote an email a couple of times, to which I received answers that your application is not considered yet because of the large influx of volunteers.</li>
    <li>During the waiting time I passed the German at B1 in Humboldt Institut, which is located on NordBahnhof. The exam is not hard.</li>
    <li>Came email to this Mon, November 7, when I was still on vacation in Kiev. Thanks to me just that day and I flew back to Germany. They invited me to come in on the 10th day (today) at 10:30 and wrote to me what number to call. They also listed the docks to bring. The language certificate was one of them.</li>
    <li>Being already in the waiting room of the new building of the ABH (Keplerstr. 2, 10589 Berlin) at 10:30 p.m. they called in the docks, gathered them and asked to wait. At the beginning of the 12th they returned the passport with a visa type sticker, which is the NE. After asking to leave me and BlaueKarte, they said that they could not hold two residence permits at the same time. I explained that some BC buns I liked better than in NE, such as absence from the country for one year with retained status. They showed that in NE there is an inscription that it is redesigned from the BC and assured that all the BC buns for me should continue to operate.</li>

  <p>With regard to the Niederlassungserlaubnis for blue card holders, the following experience was gained today. The term was sent to you as early as 3 months ago. At the same time, I now have 33 months of experience (with the latest reference from the pension reserve) and have a B1 certificate for sehr gut, so I pass through all the requirements. But from the moment I received the term I managed to change my job and at the moment I am on trial. For this reason, I was initially refused, saying that they agreed to give me everything from my old job, that now I have to wait 6 months to apply again and that I did not have to change my job at all. To the remark that I have a probationary period of only 3 months and half of it has already passed, and that about the probationary period in the requirements is not written at all, they said that it is not important, still under some conditions they have to wait for 6 months, but nevertheless all the updated documents were taken away and asked to wait. 
While waiting, I was thinking over the strategy that it was necessary to demand an official refusal from them, to find out their names, etc., and then for some reason I decided that they have no legal grounds to refuse, because I satisfy all the requirements, so they will now think about it and give me everything. With this thought, when I was invited in half an hour, I went into the office. Indeed, the lady tells me that they consulted with a colleague and despite my probationary period decided that since I am such a good specialist, they give me the permanent residence permit. They took the fingerprints again, told me to come for a new card in 6 weeks. However, when asked if I could keep my current Blaue Karte, they said that the new one was also a blame card, only with unlimited validity. 
At home, I read that if they suspected that I could be left without a livelihood, they had the right to refuse even if all the requirements in the permanent residence were met, so I was lucky. Therefore, be careful with the change of job when applying for permanent residence.</p>
