          <h1 id="internet">Internet</h1>

<p>The Internet in Germany is very poorly developed compared to Eastern Europe. The main providers are this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.vodafone.de/">Vodafone</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.telekom.de">Telekom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.o2online.de/">O2</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cablesurf.de/">CableSurf</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.1und1.de">1&amp;1</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As a rule, you will have to connect the Internet yourself after you move into the apartment. Prepare yourself for the long process, 
can take quite a while (up to 1-2 months) and is nervous. At [Check24.de] (https://www.check24.de/) you can [compare] (https://www.check24.de/dsl-handy/input/) the tariffs between
and their prices. There you can also see the availability of the tariff in your particular home (brutal traffic lights) or on the site of a particular provider. It is strongly recommended that you check the availability of the tariff at both [Check24.de] (https://www.check24.de/) and the provider’s website once again for your specific address, as the information may vary.</p>

<p>Sometimes the provider’s website may contain irrelevant information about your home, and even the technical support will assure you that
everything will be typed-top, but in fact, it may turn out that this tariff will not be available to you. You may be offered a lower rate or you may be asked to cancel an existing contract unilaterally.</p>

<h2 id="connections">Connections</h2>

<p>Depending on where you are staying, you may be able to choose from a variety of connectivity options, but you won’t find the best one here,
because, as practice shows, DSL, that cable may or may not be miserable in every single case.</p>

<ul>
  <li>DSL;</li>
  <li>VDSL;</li>
  <li>Kabel;</li>
  <li>HSDPA/LTE.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the above types of connection can be extremely bad in its own way, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DSL - may suddenly be slower than the one stated in the contract;</li>
  <li>VDSL - the same rake as above;</li>
  <li>Kabel - can “sag” in the evenings, it is necessary to treat with caution to such type of connection in the big inhabited complexes in the central areas;</li>
  <li>HSDPA/LTE - may not have sufficient coverage in your area/house or if you decide to live in a basement or bunker.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>Different ISPs offer different connectivity options, hence the different types of equipment that you need to get the Internet up and running. The options are quite different, such as a DSL router, (W)LAN router, DSL+LTE hybrid models, or fully LTE routers.</p>

<p>Such equipment can be either paid or free of charge. When choosing a tariff, you need to watch carefully what you take “in load”. If you already have your own fashion router, it is likely to be more profitable for you to take the option of free equipment from your provider, because you will be able to connect your router to it yourself.</p>

<h1 id="contract">Contract</h1>

<p>Once you have decided on the provider and type of connection, you need to carefully understand that the price of all “promotional” pages of providers is specified for
the first year of use, and in almost all cases doubles in the second year. Almost all contracts are designed for 2 years without the possibility of _(in fact, it is possible, but with big reservations) _ to change providers.</p>

<p>Even at the conclusion of the contract, to you can try to steal any paid nonsense, such as Security Package which is free of charge the first three months and then - for a fee. In most cases, you will need to make Kündigung (Withdrawal Request) in your provider’s personal office one month before the package becomes available for a fee. For example, in the case of Vodafone, you can cancel a security package (Sicherheitspaket) [here] (https://kabel.vodafone.de/kontakt/formular?formKey=EMailDiensteSicherheitspaketKuendigungKunde).</p>

<p>You can also try to negotiate a mobile phone contract, of course, for 2 years, too, if you miss this point - then you won’t get away with it.</p>

<h2 id="traffic-restrictions">Traffic restrictions</h2>

<p>Some ISPs don’t seem to have realized it’s 2017 yet. Under the terms of your tariffs (specify for yourself at the time of reading), there is a limit on the total amount of traffic that you have driven through the channel in one billing period. After reaching the limit, your speed is usually limited to 64 Kbps.</p>

<p>Always read the full description of the product (tariff) on the site, read the smallest font. Don’t forget - Germany is a legal country. It works here and it will be a big problem for you if you don’t want to play here by these rules. Everything rests on laws, contracts, paperwork. Nobody will deal with you much. The agreement was signed - pay. Have you signed up for traffic restrictions? You will have to eat a cactus for the entire term of the contract, under which you have signed - and this is usually 2 years.</p>

<h2 id="changing-providers">Changing providers</h2>

<p>You can change providers by writing to Kündigung 3 months before the end of your contract, otherwise your current contract will be renewed for another year**.
You will then contact your new provider with a request for connection and inform them of the date on which your previous contract was terminated.</p>

<p>If you have the right to cancel your contract prematurely, you are considered a “new customer” for the new provider, not someone who changes providers. Contract prices for new customers are usually cheaper.</p>

<p>As it turns out, if you have a DSL connected and need to connect to another DSL, it is not possible to have two simultaneous DSL connections from different providers. Which of course is frustrating because 
you will most likely have a time lag in this time interval.</p>

<h2 id="khaki">Khaki</h2>

<p>Here are described various known “khaki” that you can try to use to relieve all the pain of the German service and the Internet in particular.</p>

<p><strong>1. The contract with Vodafone is concluded, and the technician will not know when (after 3 weeks)</strong></p>

<p>We’re not panicking. Contact customer support via phone or [Facebook group] (https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/vodafoneDE), explain the situation
and ask for an LTE modem with a free 50 Gigabyte Internet package for a month. This modem comes with a SIM card and looks like a small box,
has a small size and works simply according to the principle: plug in the SIM card - connect to WiFi.</p>

<p><strong>2. Low speed on Vodafone?</strong></p>

<p>Contact customer support via phone or [Facebook group] (https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/vodafoneDE) and ask for a discount or a couple of free months’ worth of Internet access. You are more likely to be offered a free High-speed package on your mobile phone if you have a Vodafone or if you are offered to activate a traffic package on an LTE modem (see hack #1) while they cause you problems on your DSL/Kabel.</p>

<p><strong>3. My contract with Vodafone is coming to an end. There is an option to save money</strong></p>

<p>As a rule, from the second year onwards, the contract price increases. If you send to Vodafone a notice of termination of the contract, the phone number 0800 - 664 76 08 “call and stay” will appear in your personal cabinet
If you call and say that you decided to stay - you can get bonus conditions as for new customers (free connection and WiFi router) + 3 months free of charge. Don’t forget that a new contract for 2 years will begin!</p>

<p><strong>4. Are you going to connect to Telekom? Take your time!</strong></p>

<p>Go to their official website, there is an online chat room. Tell me that you are a new client and are now thinking between Telekom and X provider.
Ask for a discount or free Internet for the first couple of months in exchange for the fact that you will give preference to Telekom.</p>

<p>**5. have you just graduated from university or are you still relatively young? Great news!</p>

<p>Some ISPs have noticed Telekom, Vodafone and 1&amp;1 have tariffs for “youth”. As a rule, they are available for clients, 
under 27-28 years old. Such tariffs are cheaper than the rest.</p>

<p><strong>6. I need to send the router back to the provider. Do I have to pay? WTF?</strong></p>

<p>Call the call centre and insist that a courier be sent to you. Returning what you received for free and paying for it is bullshit from any point of view.</p>

<p>In general, the service rule in Germany is simple - ask and agree. Until you try to impose your terms and conditions on the company (within adequate limits) - you will be provided with a service under the contract, or worse (as practice shows).</p>

<p>There are two types of contract cancellation in Germany:</p>

<p>1) Die reguläre (ordentliche) Kündigung - 3 months’ standard notice;
2) Die vorzeitige (außerordentliche) Kündigung - early termination due to extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>The second option will be considered here, and some features will need to be referred to in order to terminate the contract with your provider under these conditions.
Here is an indicative list of situations where you are entitled to request an early termination of the contract:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the connection is technically impossible in your apartment;</li>
  <li>If you change from DSL to Kabel and you have your DSL cut off, but Kabel is not connected for months;</li>
  <li>If the connection speed is very low;</li>
  <li>If the line is physically damaged;</li>
  <li>If you are moving within Germany or from Germany;</li>
  <li>If the technician does not come to the appointed appointment;</li>
  <li>If the equipment (modem) is defective;</li>
  <li>If you politely ask and you will be lowered.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is suggested that you look for the exact list yourself or contact a lawyer who will charge you as much money as your entire annual Internet contract will cost.</p>

<p>An indicative list of laws to rely on if you decide to press your ISP with this topic in case you have a slow Internet speed:</p>

<p>§ 626 https://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/626.html</p>
<ul>
  <li>§ 314 https://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/314.html</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also [Munich court decision 223 C 20760/14 of 07.11.2014] (http://www.damm-legal.de/ag-muenchen-viel-zu-langsames-dsl-ist-ausserordentlicher-kuendigungsgrund), which states that a person was able to terminate the contract prematurely, having an official speed of 18 Mbit/sec, although in fact the speed did not exceed 6 Mbit/sec. It is recommended to read it, compare your situation and the situation described there. This should help in writing the letter to the provider.</p>

<p>As a rule, in order for your complaints to be substantiated, it is necessary to collect data on connection speed on different days, at least 3 consecutive days. It is recommended to find out
 Which speed check your particular ISP recommends, they all have different speeds and are usually branded and integrated with their ticket system.</p>

<p>You should not wave your fists if the speed, for example, is 45 Mbit/sec, and the contract states 50 Mbit/sec. As it is so-called “up to …”. In the same way
 the contract must have a baseline velocity bar declared. At Vodafone, for example, on DSL 50 tariff it is 27.9 Mbit/sec for downloading and 2.7 Mbit/sec for aload.</p>

<p>If the speed is stably lower than these parameters - think for yourself. Chances to “jump off” are very high.</p>

<p>In the letter to the provider, it is necessary to specify terms in which it should eliminate malfunctions in your opinion, 
 Otherwise, by the date you specified in the letter, you must have your contract terminated.</p>

<p>Here, <a href="https://www.kanzlei-hollweck.de/ratgeber/kuendigung-festnetz-dsl/">for example</a>, is a site where you can read a little more information on this topic.</p>

<p>If the provider makes a brick face, starts to ignore you and so on, you have several options for this case:</p>

<p>1) Go to [Bundesnetzagentur] (https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de) is like the German Communications Agency, where you can start complaining about the provider without going to trial. There should be an online complaint form;
 2) Seek legal advice (suddenly).</p>
