          <h1 id="taxes">Taxes</h1>

<p>Every German has a tax identification number and tax class.</p>

<h2 id="identification-number">Identification number</h2>

<p>The identification number (<strong>Identifikationsnummer</strong>) is issued automatically after the first [place of residence registration] (registration%20 place of residence%20%20 place of residence.md) in Germany. The numbering document is sent by post to the specified address of residence a few days after registration.</p>

<p>If more than a week has passed and the letter has not arrived, or if the number is needed sooner (for the employer), you can go to Finanzamt (see below) and get the document in hand. It is believed that this can be done a couple of working days after the registration of the place of residence, so that the number can be generated and assigned. Unfortunately, this is not always possible: In March 2018, Finanzamt Neukölln refused to inform Identifikationsnummer even 2 weeks after registration, citing the need to obtain it by mail. Alternatively, you can get a free letter with your identification number by sending [online application] (https://www.bzst.de/DE/Steuern_National/Steuerliche_Identifikationsnummer/ID_Eingabeformular/ID_Node.html).</p>

<p>The identification number must be given to the employer and to [bank] (20%20 and%20Banking.md Finance) (an account can be opened without a tax number, but then it must be submitted later) and [insurance company] (Insurance.md) (optional). In general, this number is needed very rarely, there is no need to remember or carry it with you.</p>

<h2 id="tax-class">Tax class</h2>

<p>The tax class (<strong>Steuerklasse</strong>) determines the amount of taxes levied on income.</p>

<p>The class mainly depends on marital status. For tax purposes, marriage (life partnership) is only taken into account when the spouses (partners) reside together in Germany, i.e. are registered in the same home. For example, if a husband comes to Germany before his wife, he will be in the single-entry class before her arrival and registration.</p>

<p>A single, childless person is in the 1st grade. A single person with a child(ren) is in 2nd grade.</p>

<p>Spouses (partners) or both have the 4th grade; or one spouse has the 3rd grade, and the second - necessarily the 5th grade. Spouses have the right to choose which of these two combinations they want to belong to. The difference is that classes 4+4 are usually advantageous when both spouses work and receive approximately the same income.</p>

<p><strong>Classes 3+5</strong> are usually advantageous when only one of the spouses works or the income of the other spouse is much lower. In this case, a working (earning much more) spouse takes the 3rd grade and a non-working (earning much less) spouse takes the 5th grade. The tax rates in the 3rd grade are lower than in the 4th grade and higher in the 5th grade than in the 4th grade. **Note: **If the spouses have to file a 3+5 tax return together, otherwise they will be recalculated in the 4th grade and one will be charged (5th), and the other will be deducted (3rd).</p>

<p>The 6th grade is assigned to people who have more than one job at a time. This is the class that levies the most taxes.</p>

<p>The tax authority automatically assigns a tax class after registration of the place of residence. As a rule, by default, if the spouses are registered together and at the same time, they will both be assigned the 4th class, and in other cases the 1st class will be assigned. However, it may happen that they will be assigned 1st or even 6th grade! Therefore, it is always better to reinsure yourself and go to find out, and if necessary - to change your tax class. To choose a combination of 3+5 classes, you need to apply.</p>

<p>It is best to do this immediately after receiving the tax number, without delay, otherwise there is a possibility that some time (and even before the end of the year) taxes will be charged on the old class. However, after the end of the year and the submission of the declaration (see below), it will be possible to recalculate and refund overpaid taxes.</p>

<p><strong>To change classes</strong> you need to come to Finanzamt (see below) and submit the corresponding [application] (https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/printout/034003.pdf) (you can take the form from Finanzamt). Spouses should come together because the application is submitted jointly. Finanzamt employees can allow one spouse to apply for both, but they can also refuse to do so. Everyone must bring their passport, residence registration document and tax number with them. Once you have submitted your application, you will immediately receive a tax class assignment document.</p>

<p>How to fill in the form:
<strong>Section A</strong> is divided into 2 parts, for two spouses respectively, you need to fill in all the lines of the section. In <strong>Section B</strong> we mark only line 17, in which you want to mark the current tax classes of the spouses (if you have not changed it before it is 4/4), and line 18 in which you specify the desired. In line 43 <strong>Sections C</strong> you need to put the date and signatures of the two spouses.</p>

<p><img src="files/be.png" alt="" /> March 2018. Finanzamt Neukölln has not issued any change of tax class documents, offering to wait for the post office.</p>

<p><img src="files/be.png" alt="" /> May 2018. Finanzamt Mitte also did not issue the document and said they would send it to the employer.</p>

<p><img src="files/be.png" alt="" /> September 2018. Finanzamt Mitte. Except for the application, no documents were requested. Accepted without a wife’s tax number (left the field blank) and entered my current class. I applied myself without my wife. Borrowed all 2 minutes. They said that the new class is already available in the program from accountants, no paperwork was given.</p>

<p>Immediately after receiving the new tax class you need to notify the employer**. Moreover, it happens that the employer withholds taxes from the employee at the maximum, 6th grade until the employee confirms the appointment of another class - so it is better to get a document confirming your class from Finanzamt as soon as possible and give a copy of it to the employer.</p>

<h2 id="finanzamt">Finanzamt</h2>

<p>Unlike residence registration, <strong>Finanzamt</strong> will only serve you <strong>at your place of residence</strong>. You can find out which Finanzamt you belong to on the [official website] (http://gemfa.bzst.bund.de/gemfai.exe). The easiest way to do this is to enter your postcode (choose Postleitzahl from the Art des Suchbegriffs list).</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="tax-return-and-tax-refund">Tax return and tax refund</h2>

<p>After the end of each calendar year, a tax return must be submitted. This may be mandatory (e.g. for classes 3+5 if both spouses worked in the reporting year). However, even if you do not have to file a declaration, it makes sense.</p>

<p>Taxes are recalculated on the basis of the declaration and, in many cases, substantial amounts are refunded (tax refund, tax deduction). The opposite situation is also possible when you are asked to pay more.</p>

<p>A declaration can be made and filed in several ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact a consultant at <strong>Lohnsteuerhilfeverein</strong> (association for help with tax returns), who will prepare and submit a tax return for you and communicate with the tax authorities. The services of a consultant can cost from one to several hundred Euros depending on your income. It is also important to remember that the first time you file a tax return with such a consultant, you usually apply for membership in the association to which the consultant belongs. If you plan to file your own declaration the following year, you should explicitly withdraw from the association. And you usually need to do this before the next tax year begins. Examples of Lohnsteuerhilfeverein:

  </li>
  <li>Contact a <strong>Steuerberater</strong> if you are unable to use <strong>Lohnsteuerhilfeverein</strong> for any reason. The reason may be that you or your spouse is not an employee but a freelancer or an entrepreneur (Lohnsteuerhilfeverein simply does not have the right to tax the self-employed), or you just have some complicated case of taxes (different sources of income or high costs that you want to write off from the taxable base). Steuerberater’s services are much more expensive than Lohnsteuerhilfeverein’s consultants (conditionally from 500 Euros for filing a tax return, depending on the income and complexity of the case). In general, employees should be able to apply for a Lohnsteuerhilfeverein even in the first year after moving.</li>

  <li>By yourself - through the official program - [Elster] (https://www.elster.de/), here you can find some explanations in English - http://www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/ELSTER</li>
  <li>Fill out a paper form or [PDF] (https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/ffw/catalog/openFolder.do?path=catalog%3A%2F%2FSteuerformulare%2Fest) on your own.
You can fill in a good [book] (http://www.amazon.de/Konz-Das-Arbeitsbuch-zur-Steuererkl%C3%A4rung/dp/3426787881) in German for yourself. It is published annually to reflect changes in legislation. It is recommended to get acquainted at least once to understand the basic principles of taxation in Germany.</li>

</ul>

<p>It is recommended that you apply to Lohnsteuerhilfeverein for the first year of your life in Germany or use the services of a tax advisor. In the first year, you can get a large refund. A few comments on this subject:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A large refund is due to the fact that the annual income tax depends on the amount received in that year. Your company pays income tax based on your salary for 12 months. Thus, if you received the money in less than 12 months, as you arrived in, say, October, it means that the company has listed too much tax and you are entitled to a refund. Keywords for your search: Steuerfreibetrag, Progressionsvorbehalt.</li>
  <li>The amount of income for the year is the main factor for calculating income tax. Therefore, if you work, for example, from January 1 to December 31 (the whole year in full), it is likely that you will not get a large refund.</li>
  <li>If you come alone and your wife, disabled children, parents with low incomes, whom you have supported financially, are temporarily left behind, it can also be beneficial for you in a tax sense. Information](https://github.com/ru-de/faq/raw/master/files/parentstaxreturn.doc) about tax refunds for parental assistance.</li>
  <li>Moving expenses (Umzugskosten) can have an impact on your taxes. If you are moving within Germany, you need to make the move conditional on your employment (e.g. the time spent travelling to work is significantly reduced).</li>
  <li>The tax office may require an income report before moving to Germany, so it is advisable to have an income report from the previous place of residence (2-NDFL in Russia).</li>
</ul>

<p>General recommendation: Keep all receipts and receipts for the entire time in Germany, sort by year. Especially from anything that might have something to do with your work.</p>

<p>You need to submit your declaration by the end of May** (2019 to the end of July) of the following year, but if you are using a tax consultant, by the end of next year.</p>

<p>If you have never filed a tax return, you have 7 years to do so. The procedure for filing previous years’ declarations does not matter.</p>

<h2 id="refunds-of-taxes-for-helping-close-relatives">Refunds of taxes for helping close relatives</h2>
<p>The general idea is that you can reduce your tax base by helping your close relatives outside of Germany, whose income does not reach the minimum subsistence level in Germany. More information can be found at https://www.tupa-germania.ru/nalogi/spisat-podderzhku-rodstvennikam.html</p>

<p>Next, a personal experience</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In 2017, he transferred $150 each month to his mother through Western Union. Mom is a retired woman, she doesn’t work. This year I sent her a document that the tax authorities require to fill in and certify with the local state body (in our case, the passport office of the Russian Federation). She filled in the document, but she couldn’t get a stamp anywhere, and it’s clear that nobody wants to sign it and put a stamp on some strange form. Instead, we decided to take a certificate of family composition and a certificate of pension payments for the year, as well as made a translation of these two certificates in Russia with a notary certification. He filled in the tax return himself via Smartsteuer. After filling in the electronic form by letter, he additionally sent to the tax office a completed, but not certified document, which they require and these two certificates from Russia. The refunds were made, nothing was additionally requested. They returned about 20% of the transferred amount.</p>

<p>As you know, if you have lived in Germany for less than 5 years, you are not entitled to a pension from Germany. If you decide to leave the country and the EU (important! Here and below, the phrase “moving out of Germany” means moving out of the EU and probably UK\EEA (todo: to clarify)), you have the right to receive your pension contributions back. For reference, this is 9.35% of your gross salary (as of 2017).</p>

<p>Next is a free translation of the topic from [ToyTownGermany] (https://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/topic/371985-pension-refund-experience-after-moving-to-the-us/)</p>

<p>Official website http://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/en/Navigation/englisch_index_node.html</p>

<ul>
  <li>By “5 years” we mean “60 months of contributions”. Depending on the situation, contributions made in another EU country may also be taken into account here, so if your situation is similar to “59 months in Germany and 2 years in the UK”, it is better to check in advance and consult a lawyer.</li>
  <li>You should not be a citizen of the EU/EEA/CH</li>
  <li>The possibility to refund your contributions only appears <strong>after 2 years</strong> from the moment of moving from Germany.</li>
  <li>Two forms must be completed: <a href="http://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/de/Inhalt/5_Services/04_formulare_und_antraege/_pdf/V0901.html?cms_resultsPerPage=5&amp;cms_templateQueryString=V0901+">V0901</a> (basic application for return) and [A1310] (http://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/de/Inhalt/5_Services/04_formulare_und_antraege/_pdf/A1310.html) (details for international payment if you do not have an account with a German bank)</li>
  <li>You should also visit [the German Embassy in your country] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85<em>%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9</em>%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8) to confirm your personal data and signature (?)</li>
  <li>Then send a package of documents (at least a copy of your passport and completed and signed applications) to the German pension fund at
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund
Ruhrstr. 2
10709 Berlin
Germany</code></li>
  <li>The money must be in your account within 6-8 weeks.</li>
