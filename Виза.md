# Getting a national visa


Important: as soon as you have an offer, and maybe even before that, make an online appointment at the embassy to apply for a work visa.

![](files/ua.gif) As of March 2017, you can sign up at the Kiev Embassy the next day. Made in one week. But this is luck, be sure to check in advance on the [embassy website] (https://service2.diplo.de/rktermin/extern/choose_realmList.do?locationCode=kiew&request_locale=en)

![](files/ru.gif) As of February 2017, in Moscow you can sign up for 2 days in advance, no full house is observed.
As of July 2017, the embassy has recorded 3 weeks in advance. There is a queue at the embassy itself. Xerox copies cost 50 rubles per sheet - make all possible copies in advance.

Even if you apply for a Blue Card - the embassy in your country gives you a national labor visa valid for 90 days (according to the latest data, the Russian Federation issues it for 6 months). The Blue Card is already issued in Germany, although when you apply at the embassy, your application will be marked with a note about your forthcoming Blue Card request.

Important: tourist or business-shengen will not be rented - by law you are not allowed to work with this type of visa. If you already have a valid visa in your passport, there is a chance that it will be cancelled when you issue a German national visa (there are cases where a tourist annual Schengen was left behind).
The list of required documents is available on the embassy's website (![](files/ru.gif) [here](http://www.germania.diplo.de/contentblob/3736096/Daten/6359078/bluecard.pdf)). As of the beginning of summer 2015, there was no need for an apostille on the documents, just a notarization.

![](files/ru.gif) February 2018. Note for those who actually reside in the region, whose consular district differs from the consular district by registration. For example, you are registered in Ufa, and live in Kazan without registration and apply to the Moscow Embassy. The embassy will definitely ask you to confirm that you really do not have a residence permit: in my case, they asked for a copy of the rental agreement and a copy of any utility bill, preferably the latter. If this is the case for you, prepare these documents in advance. Otherwise, you will have to send them by e-mail, which will delay the process a little bit.

Among other documents, you will need to provide your employment contract, signed by your employer, and a printout of the recognition of your profession and degree in Germany, using the [Anabin] catalogue (http://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/institutionen.html). A few more details can be found [here] (http://surfin-birds.ru/dokumenty-na-vizu-dlya-poiska-raboty-v-germanii/)
- Looking for your university (section Institutionen), print a page where you can see that it has an H+ rating
- Looking for your specialization (section Hochschulabschlüsse), just find it in any other university in your country, which also has an H+ rating, print this page too

If your specialty is not in this catalogue, you will have to recognize your diploma yourself. It will cost 200 euros for one educational level (bachelor or master), it took me a little more than three weeks. More information can be found on the website of Semen Babkin - [here] (http://www.tupa-germania.ru/rabota/priznanie-diploma-v-germanii.html) and [here] (http://www.tupa-germania.ru/rabota/kak-podtverdit-diplom-v-germanii.html). There is also an article about the confirmation of the diploma in [de_faq] (Confirmation of%20diploma.md).

While you are in your country, it is worth taking care of apostilles for documents on family status.

The decision on Anabin and other documents (e.g.: a contract signed by the employer via email) is made by a specific attaché at the consulate. It is best to ask an employee to check the compliance of all documents with the attaché right now, if possible.

## Extension of the visa

**" For Blue Card holders 


1. Make a *early* term in the ABH, see details. [corresponding FAQ section](ABX.md)
2. Photograph yourself (spouse, etc.) format 35x45 mm, 1 piece. each.
3. take a certificate from your employer that you really work there, Arbeitsbescheinigung is called
4. On the appointed day and hour, come to the ABH and wait for the assigned number to appear on the screen. Have with you (only originals, copies are not needed):
- old blue card (with insert!)
- work contract
- Arbeitsbescheinigung certificate
- photograph
- passport (I wasn't asked, but just in case, let it be)
- cash for payment of duties (the machine also accepts EC-cards)

All the spouse needed was a passport and a picture.

It took half an hour. The spouse was immediately glued a new visa into the passport, the plastic will have to wait about a month. For the time of registration a piece of paper is issued, which works as an alternative to the temporary residence permit, if the terms of the old Civil Code are tightened. Valid for 2 months, during which time the new card must be ready. I do not recommend traveling with it, even within the EU! 

The cost of the question depends on the extension period. If the work contract is unlimited, the blue card is extended for a maximum of 4 years. In October 2017, this extension cost 142 euros for two people with their spouse.

**Transferring the Blue Card to the new passport**.

As your Blue Card is tied to your passport by number, you will need to transfer it to your new passport when you change your passport. You will need to do this:
1. Make the term [ABH] (ABH.md) *or* Bürgeramt (new since 2019).
2. Bring it:
- old passport
- new passport
- one picture
- a valid Blue Card together with the insert (if you have it separately and not glued).
3. Fee between 12 and 67 Euros depending on the Blue Card format (in February 2019, Bürgeramt II am S-Bahnhof Schönweide only paid the fee in a sticker format for 20 minutes).

Attention! If the old passport:
 - You have been taken away from you when you receive a new one (e.g. at the consulate of your country)
 - or expired more than six months ago 
 - or your name/birthday has been changed in your passport
 - your Blue Card wasn't made in Berlin
 - " the term should only be used in the ABH
