<p>Germany’s traffic rules are called Straßenverkehrsordnung (StVO), you can find it in German on [the website] (https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung) or a good translation (2010) in [Russian] (http://levy.com.ru/docs/stvo/)</p>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p>Q: I just got here, I have national rights of my country - what do I need to know?</p>

<p>A: Depending on the country, it is likely that your rights are only valid for the first 6 months, then they will need to be <a href="#Exchange-rights">exchanged</a></p>

<p>Q: Is there a difference in the rules of my country and Germany?</p>

<p>A: Most likely, it is recommended to go to driving school and listen to theoretical lectures even if you change your license. Details and grey areas of StVO are also described in the special <a href="#Split in the rules">section</a></p>

<h1 id="getting-your-license">Getting your license</h1>
<p>As in any other cultural country, in Germany you need a driving licence (Führerschein) to drive a car and other vehicles. Hereinafter the default is <strong>Category B</strong>, i.e. conventional vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of 3.5 t or less, possibly with a trailer of up to 750 kg.</p>

<h4 id="learning-from-scratch">Learning from scratch</h4>
<p>If you come to Germany without a driver’s license, but want to get it, you will have to study “in full program”, i.e. to go to the mandatory theory and roll back the mandatory practical hours, which usually pours out about 2-3 times more money than the exchange (~ 2500 euros vs. ~ 800)</p>
<h3 id="the-exchange-of-rights">The exchange of rights</h3>
<p>Rights issued outside Germany are only valid in Germany for the first 6 months after the first residence permit (Anmeldung) and then must be exchanged for German rights. Please note that <em>not in Germany the driver’s license is valid</em>, i.e. nobody forbids you to travel to Poland or Austria, rent a car there and travel to the rest of the European Union under national law.</p>

<p>Requirements to replace the rights of different states to German can be found [here] (http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/fachspezifisch/HA-III/Dokumente/Fuehrerschein/Staatenliste-Umschreibung-ausl-FS.pdf), but in general the situation is such that the holders of the rights of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus (as of 2017) need to pass both practical and theoretical exams, the only relaxation is exemption from the mandatory hours of theory and practice.</p>

<p>Replacement process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign up for the driving school, get a paper stamped by the school</li>
  <li>Take a first aid course and a vision test</li>
  <li>Submit a set of documents to confirm your rights</li>
  <li>Wait 1-6 weeks after the confirmation is received, sign up for the theoretical exam</li>
  <li>Waiting for the theoretical exam, come on in.</li>
  <li>You sign up for a practical exam</li>
  <li>Waiting for a practical exam, come on in.</li>
  <li>You get the desired plastic</li>
</ul>

<p>Practice shows that most of the time is spent waiting for terms and exams.</p>

<h4 id="request-for-confirmation-of-rights">Request for confirmation of rights</h4>
<p>In order to be admitted to the exams, you must give up your rights to the test. Usually the following is required for this purpose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A certificate from the driving school is issued when registering at the driving school</li>
  <li>Certificate of completion of the first aid course (the course takes place during the whole day, it is usually possible to pass it in driving school or nearby), validity period - for an indefinite period of time. Recommended courses in Berlin: <a href="http://www.drk-intern.de/adressen/drk-kurstermine-suchergebnisse.html">1</a> at рус\англ\нем language and <a href="http://www.ersthelfer.tv">2</a>, it is easier to get the term for more convenient days and cheaper.</li>
  <li>Certificate of vision test (0.7 and better - without glasses, less than 0.7 - you need glasses and will need a note in your rights), the validity period - two years.</li>
  <li>Photo 3.5*4.5 of the “huge face” format.</li>
  <li>Original of national rights</li>
  <li>Copy of national rights (Berlin)</li>
  <li>Certified translation of national rights into German (by sworn translator). Not accepted without translation!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the required documents on the website and get the term there:</p>

<p>Confirmation costs 42.60 euros (2017), payment upon application. You may be asked if you would like to submit to TUV or Dekra (10.2017, Munich - not asked). No principal difference is noticed, but if asked, it is recommended to choose TUV. The testing period varies from a few days to 16 weeks, but is usually 4-6 weeks. The original driver’s license is taken away when you submit it. You can then return your license, when you receive and hand over the documents, you just need to ask for it. You can pick up after 1-2 weeks of verification by signing up for the term again. As of 2017, Munich gives without questions, the main thing is to come to the second term with a passport and a paper confirming that your rights have been accepted.</p>

<h5 id="return-of-national-rights">Return of national rights</h5>
<p>But it happens that a Fahrerlaubnisbehörde employee begins to claim that the rights do not come back. Until now, no one has found a way to prove him wrong (except to go to another employee). It is recommended to make a copy, which will be useful for car rental in the future.</p>

<p>If you are not convinced not to take away your national rights, you should write [free form letter] (files/DrivingLicenseReturnTemplate.md) asking for it back.</p>

<p><strong>UPD: Munich.</strong> September 2017. When issuing new German rights, the Ukrainian ones with the sticker that the German ones were issued were also given away.</p>

<p><strong>UPD: Berlin.</strong> May 2018. A year and a half after the exchange, he re-applied for the return of his Belarusian rights. I returned on the grounds that I had a category “A” there and I want to ride a motorcycle in my home country. I applied through the window, issued a ticket, received and returned the rights within 10 minutes. Everyone speaks German, except for one guy, to whom I was sent. A template of such a return application in connection with an additional category] (files/Driving_licence_back.pdf).</p>

<p><strong>UPD: Berlin.</strong> March 2018. When submitting the application, the original rights were not taken away. According to experience and information from Berlin acquaintances, no one’s rights are taken away from them when they apply in Berlin.</p>

<p><strong>UPD: Berlin.</strong> April 2018. He came to take away his rights after passing the exam and asked me to leave my national rights. The guy said that national rights are returned only if they have a category that is not in the German rights category. In other words, if the national rights have categories B and C, but only B, the national rights can be retained.</p>

<p><strong>UPD: Hamburg.</strong> August 2017. In response to a letter written as above, [response] comes (files/russishe_fuererherscein_zuruck.jpg),
you can’t have two rights at once.</p>

<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>

<p>The theoretical examination consists of 30 questions of different degrees of “importance” (different number of “points”), including video questions and variable questions (the essence is the same, but the picture, the color of the car or the pedestrian’s sex change). The total number of questions is about 1300, excluding variations. The theoretical examination is available in 12 languages, including Russian and English. The choice of answers is always multiple, at least one option is always correct. To pass the exam successfully, you need to score no more than 10 “points” (more errors - more points), and two “five-point” errors are not allowed.</p>

<p>When submitting the theory, you must provide confirmation from Bürgeramt and the driving school. 
You can pay the fee for the theory on site. 
The result of the examination is immediately communicated to you on site and a paper confirmation of the examination is also issued. If you fail, you will have to try again after two weeks at the earliest.</p>

<p>You can find the place where you can take the exam at [TUV] (https://www.tuv.com/de/deutschland/locations/locationsglobal.jsp?location=Berlin&amp;radius=10&amp;topic=18880) or [Dekra] (https://www.dekra.de/de-de/standorte/). However, it is better to ask the instructor for a list of the latest information for your case, because not all offices provide the full range of services.</p>

<p>Training programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://www.fuehrerschein-lernsystem.de/main.asp is a handy website, where you can show a variety of questions, you can mark “difficult” questions, categorization, mobile applications, comments on questions. You can answer 300 questions free of charge, and the paid version ranges from 6 euros for 1 month to 40 euros for an unlimited period of time. But only in German (you can try to translate Google in English).</li>
  <li>https://ru.fuehrerschein-bestehen.de - multilingual program, from 25 (1 month) to 50 euros (3 months).</li>
  <li>http://app.fahrschulcard.de/ - software from driving schools, there is Russian, look for логин\пароль with friends (according to the available information, accounts are valid for 2 years after registration) or buy from the school (about 70 euros)</li>
  <li>http://www.fahren-lernen.de/ - Also a good program. Online registration is not possible, you need to go to any driving school, pay for registration to get the name / password</li>
</ul>

<p>**” What language should I use to pass the theory?
It is logical to assume that if you know German at a sufficient level, it is better to pass in the original - you can be sure that there are no errors in translation.
As for the Russian language for theory, in general, there are no problems. There are only a handful of questions where the meaning of the answer choices changes because of the translation, but such questions are literally a couple from the whole list. Specific examples: 1.2.19-113 and 2.5.01-010.</p>

<p><strong>Stopway calculation formulas</strong>
 Among the options there are many different questions about braking, stopping and reactionary pathways. The formula is used for this:</p>

<p><img src="files/formel_anhalteweg.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<p>The practical exam lasts ~45 minutes and includes technical questions before starting the journey (how to check the oil level, where the parking lights are switched on, how to check the tires, etc.), traffic in the city (including zones 30) and traffic on the autobahn.
One of our brother’s most important and unusual requirements on the exam is to turn your head, the so-called Schulterblick. It is not enough to check the situation on the mirrors, it is necessary to turn your head to the left by 90 degrees (beginning of movement, turns and rearrangements to the left, etc.) and to the right over your shoulder, looking through the window of the rear right door (turns and rearrangements to the right, etc.), so that the examiner sees that you are turning your head.</p>

<p>**” When I passed the exam, will I get plastic on the spot?</p>

<p>Only for new rights, and depending on the land.</p>

<p>When you change your license, you have to take back your old license. The examiner does not have the right to do so, so they issue new rights and take away old ones from the office.</p>

<p>New rights in NRW can be granted on the spot. In Berlin, a pink piece of paper is given out on the spot after it has been handed over, which replaces the rights in Germany. Plastic rights will be ready in 2-3 weeks. It is better to call or ask a question in the [contact form] (https://www.berlin.de/labo/mobilitaet/fahrerlaubnisse-personen-und-gueterbefoerderung/formular.264669.php) to make sure they are ready or not before picking up the rights. In Berlin, the rights are given to Puttkamerstr. 16 - 18, 10958 Berlin. [Service page] (https://service.berlin.de/standort/121646/)</p>

<h3 id="buying-a-car">Buying a car</h3>

<p>As everywhere else, the basic fundamental questions of “what kind of car?”, “new or second-hand”, “private or dealer/repurchase? If you have to answer the first two questions on your own, you can write about the bids in Germany separately.</p>

<p>Most of the ads are bribes, so-called handlers (Händler). What’s good about them is that they have to <em>provide a car warranty</em>. Usually, this warranty is a year in which you can complain for the first half of the year and it is up to the dealer to prove that the fault is yours (which is almost unrealistic), and for the second half of the year you have to prove that the fault is the dealer’s (which is also almost unrealistic) fault. Therefore, you can consider that the warranty is six months. Also, some dealers may offer an extended warranty, perhaps for an additional fee. And yes, all this applies to used cars.
If you buy a car from a private person (privat), by default it does not provide any warranty, and also in a standard remote control it can be specified explicitly.</p>

<p>Regardless of the seller, pay attention to the TUV. The ideal option is if the TUV was made recently (1-2-3 months ago) or if the seller agrees to make a new one when selling. If the TUV expires in six months and the seller refuses to make a new one - it is better to think twice, there are all chances to get a “bucket”, not allowed to move.</p>

<p>There is no single form of DPK here, but on site sites and on the ADAC site ([link] (https://www.adac.de/der-adac/rechtsberatung/musterkaufvertraege-musterformulare/vorlagen/)) you can find standard contract templates for all cases of life. It is interesting to note that the local contract contains much more details than at home. For example, here the seller signs under the current mileage and claims like “no taxi use, no damage, no car accident”. Accordingly, if it turns out that the seller deliberately kept silent about the “dark” moments in the history of the car, that is, all chances for a refund and termination of the contract (consult with lawyers!)
At the conclusion of the contract it is standard to pay an “advance payment” on the spot (100-500 euros), which, of course, should be noted in the contract. The main part of the amount the seller can ask to transfer to his account, to agree or to insist on the transfer of cash - your business. In any case, do not transfer a cent in any way until the contract is signed in two copies.</p>

<p>Each dealer usually has red numbers - you can ride the car with them and feel the car. If you are not allowed to ride the car, then, as everywhere, it is better to think about it 10 times.</p>

<p>The largest site http://www.mobile.de/, private ads there as well. There is also http://autoscout24.de.</p>

<p>A lot of dealers are scattered around the city, usually closer to industrial zones, selling used/commissioned cars. Runs are also twisted. Some give a guarantee, some do not. In general, everything is as everywhere, without a person who understands the cars, you can get. Yes, and with a person, too, roulette.</p>

<p>Buying guide http://www.tupa-germania.ru/avtomobil/pokupka-avtomobilja.html</p>

<h4 id="car-registration">Car registration</h4>
<p>Registration of a car or registration is called Kfz-Zulassung.</p>

<p>Unlike Russia, where the license plate is tied to the car, here the license plates are more tied to the owner, so in most cases, when buying a used car, the seller will keep the existing numbers for himself, and you will have to make new ones when registering. But keeping license plates is also possible, but only in case of sales in the same region (pruf?), you can try to agree with the seller. However, in most cases you will have to get new numbers (or use your own from a previous car). If you wish, you can choose any of the available license plate numbers (wunschkennzeichen). This will increase the cost of registration by about 12.8 euros. To do this, it is advisable to reserve the desired number online before you register (see the links to the regional pages below) and take a confirmation printout of the selected numbers with you, but you can also say so at the time of registration.</p>

<p>The following documents are required for vehicle registration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Passport (Personalausweis, Reisepass)</li>
  <li>In some cases, the place of residence (Meldebestätigung über den Wohnsitz) of the person to be registered may be required (Munich, 2018 - not required);</li>
  <li>Two green papers about the Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil I and Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil II (if the car is new, only Teil II);</li>
  <li>A technical inspection report, also known as a TUV or Hauptuntersuchung (not required for new vehicles);</li>
  <li>A confirmation from the insurance company that they are ready to take you in for insurance (Kfz-Haftpflichtversicherung). Usually it is just a code, and it is enough;</li>
  <li>SEPA-mandate for payment of car tax. Here] (https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Web/DE/Service/Apps_Rechner/KfzRechner/KfzRechner.html) you can calculate how much you will get;</li>
  <li>Application for registration;</li>
  <li>Old license plates (Kennzeichenschilder), if the car was picked up with them;</li>
  <li>New license plates (you can make on site in a dozen offices near the institution or order in advance online, will be somewhat cheaper);</li>
  <li>For electric cars and plug-in hybrids (obtaining “electro” numbers) manufacturer’s certificate (issued in the cabin).</li>
</ul>

<p>After the procedure is completed, you should receive it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New certificate of registration (Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil I);</li>
  <li>Enter your details on the supplementary sheet (Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil II), if necessary;</li>
  <li>Room stickers: regional stickers for both and a rear inspection sticker</li>
  <li>(when changing the number) Umweltplakette - “eco-sticker”, the sticker corresponding to the environmental class of the car, must be glued to the lower right side of the windscreen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The total cost of registration may vary from region to region, but can be based on ~60 euros: 30 euros registration, 20 euros room pairing, 12 euros choice of any number, 6 euros Umweltplakette.</p>

<p>Registration of the car is also possible by proxy. You can download the power of attorney form [here] (https://www.adac.de/-/media/adac/pdf/jze/musterkaufvertraege/vollmacht-zulassung-fahrzeuges.pdf).</p>

<p>Also remember that you must notify the state and make changes to the car registration documents when moving (if you change the region, you can also change your license plate number).</p>

<p><strong>UPD: Berlin.</strong> April 2019. The price for printing a number pair in Liechtenstein (Kfz-Zulassungsbehörde-Lichtenberg) is 17.50 EUR.</p>

<p>Starting from February 2018 it is impossible to register live in Berlin. As of April 2018, it is also not possible to make the term online, you need to come to the station (or call) and sign up.</p>

<h4 id="inspection">Inspection</h4>
<p>Every 2 years you need to do a car inspection (for new cars the first inspection is done after 3 years). Two organizations - TUV and DEKRA - are involved in the technical inspection of the car. The technical condition of the vehicle and emissions of harmful substances are checked. The price of the question is 92 euros (TUV, 2017). It is also possible to apply to an auto workshop, which will deal with this issue and will be able to immediately eliminate the problems that have arisen.</p>

<p>Find out when the maintenance can be carried out by using the poster on the back number:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.financescout24.de/media/3798/tuev-hu-plakette-lesehinweis_xs.png" alt="tuv" /></p>

<p>A year in the middle, 12 hours across, a month. For the delay of more than 2 months a fine is due, and the Internet also writes that the insurance ceases to operate with the overdue maintenance.</p>

<p>There is a lot of information on the Internet about the preparation for the inspection, but not badly told in the video of Denis Ram:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q30u66fJrs. The main ones are absence of through rust, chips on the glass, work of lighting equipment (as well as correction of headlights’ inclination angle), brakes, suspension condition, absence of oil leaks, work of belts. And of course - each tuning requires its own documents. You can come to the station and ask for a quick inspection - it is not expensive, and can help to make well-considered decisions on repair, if necessary.</p>

<p>My experience - having realized that I had missed the maintenance for 2 months (I misread the poster), I made a term for the next morning. For this purpose, I used the website https://www.tuv.com/de/deutschland/pk/auto_und_verkehr/pruefstellen/suche.jsp. When I arrived half an hour earlier (just in time for the opening), I asked if I should wait. The expert said that I could stop by. The first thing he did was connect the diagnostic equipment, check the gas emissions, the operation of the lighting equipment, the level adjustment. Then I checked the work of brakes, handbrake. Then I picked up, looked at the suspension, stains, brake disks - put down the car and glued a new plaque :) Also printed a document with the results of the inspection and tips for use. It took me about 20-30 minutes to print.</p>

<h4 id="insurance-kfz-versicherung">Insurance (KFZ-Versicherung)</h4>
<p>As in many other countries, every driver in Germany is required to have third party insurance (local compulsory motor TPL insurance, Kfz-<strong>Haftpflicht</strong>). In addition to the minimum insurance, there is also the so-called Teilkasko and Vollkasko (CASCO). Teilkasko usually only covers theft, explosion, storm and other force majeure, while Vollkasko covers any damage to your vehicle.</p>

<p>Germany also has a bonus-malus system (Schadenfreiheitsklasse, SF-class). But, unlike unification of the discount at the state level (for example, as in the Russian Federation), here each insurance company can set the amount of the discount independently within certain limits. Also, each insurance company has its own algorithms for recalculating the class after the insured event (the table is called <strong>Rückstufungstabelle</strong>)</p>

<p>If you have had experience of accident-free driving in your home country, some German insurance companies allow you to read it out in Germany. For example, here is [instruction] (http://asdcode.de/blog/de_bureaucracy/64.html) for HUK24.</p>

<p>All insurance companies in Germany provide insurance for all countries that participate in the Green Card program as part of the regular insurance. At the same time, if you travel within the EU, you do not need any additional documents, but if you go to Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Moldova - you need to ask your insurance company for this very Green Card, usually it is sent free of charge. But even in the EU it is recommended to have a green card with you to avoid embarrassment and problems.</p>

<p>How to choose an insurance policy? You can go to check24.de and compare options, and <a href="https://www.huk24.de/versicherungen/kfz-versicherung/autoversicherung.jsp?nmfrom=hauptnavigation">HUK24</a> is also popular. As noted above, it is recommended to pay attention not only to the total cost, but also to the amount of discounts on SF and the change of class after the insured events.</p>

<h4 id="electro-numbers-elektrokennzeichen">“Electro” numbers (Elektrokennzeichen)</h4>
<p>“Electro” numbers are issued for electric vehicles and hybrid plug-ins, provided that the CO2 emissions are no more than 50 g/km or no less than 40 km of electric traction range (detailed requirements in the description of the service).</p>

<p>The numbers differ from the ordinary numbers by the presence of an “E” at the end of the number, e.g. “B AB 4999E”. The basic number combination can be selected in the same way as the normal number, in which case the “E” literature will be added to the selected combination when registering.</p>

<p>“Electro numbers may provide some advantages to owners, depending on the municipality, such as parking or dedicated line traffic. As of April 2019, there are no advantages in Berlin.</p>

<p>Disclaimer 1: The difference is marked by a comparison of the RF PDD and StVO. When writing, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the 2016-2017 version of the Russian version of the PDDD.</p>

<p>Disclaimer 2: references to court decisions are made to public resources, almost all the topics to which references are made are ambiguous and lengthy discussions are possible, court decisions are usually much more than one. What is written here is food for thought and key thoughts that you can look for details rather than knowingly correct statements.</p>

<p>Disclaimer 3: We remind you that the default is <strong>Category B</strong>, i.e. conventional cars with a maximum permissible weight of no more than 3.5 tons, possibly with a trailer of up to 750 kg.</p>

<p>Before we move on to the list of various points, we would like to note a few general ideas that can be traced in the German traffic police:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most of the city area is often a “zone 30”, a residential area. It is recommended that pedestrians, children and blind intersections are monitored.</li>
  <li>The presence of a large number of unregulated intersections without established priority signs. This is particularly noticeable in the above-mentioned zones 30. Accordingly, it is recommended that you never forget the “interference on the right”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Left turn</strong>: Left turn should be made using the <em>right pass</em> <a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/97-9-abbiegen-wenden-und-rueckwaertsfahren">§9.4</a></p>

<p><strong>Circle movement, priority</strong>: Contrary to popular belief, the presence of the 215 sign (“Circle movement”) itself <strong>does not give an advantage</strong> to vehicles moving in a circle. On the other hand, the German “guest” also prescribes that the sign 205 (Leave the road) or 209 (Only to the right) be placed at roundabouts. <a href="http://www.sicherestrassen.de/VKZKatalog/Kat215.htm">Part 3, Zu Zeichen 215 Kreisverkehr</a></p>

<p><strong>Roundabout, turntable</strong>: The use of a turntable at the entrance to roundabout is explicitly prohibited (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/96-8-vorfahrt">§8.1a</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Main road area</strong>: Sign 306 (“Main road”) ends with <em>only</em> 307 (“end of main road”), 205 (“Step aside”) and 206 (“Stop”). In other words, junctions do not cancel the main road sign (<a href="http://www.verwaltungsvorschriften-im-internet.de/bsvwvbund_26012001_S3236420014.htm">Part 5, Zu den Zeichen 306 und 307 Vorfahrtstraße und Ende der Vorfahrtstraße</a>)</p>

<p>**” Traffic lights  If the arrow on the optional traffic light section lights up, this ensures that your trajectory will not intersect with anyone (i.e. other vehicles and pedestrians will definitely be red). <a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/117-37-wechsellichtzeichen-dauerlichtzeichen-und-gruenpfeil">§37.1, Grüner Pfeil</a></p>

<p><strong>Traffic lights</strong>: if there is a green plate arrow (at the top right of the traffic light, next to the red light; sign 720), turn right to red (as in the U.S.), stopping in front of the traffic light and giving way to all the way. <a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/117-37-wechsellichtzeichen-dauerlichtzeichen-und-gruenpfeil">§37.1, Grünpfeil</a></p>

<p><strong>Priority</strong>: in case of narrowing of roads and end of the lane, vehicles moving along the main lane are obliged to allow the vehicle to enter from the lane that ends (on the principle of “lightning”). That is, the fact that you drive straight ahead and do not make manoeuvres does not give you an advantage over those who run out of lanes (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/95-7-benutzung-von-fahrstreifen-durch-kraftfahrzeuge">§7.4</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Lane selection</strong>: A settlement has freedom of lane selection (freie Fahrstreifenwahl) regardless of the total number of lanes (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/95-7-benutzung-von-fahrstreifen-durch-kraftfahrzeuge">§7.3</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Choice of lane when turning right, turning right from several lanes</strong>: not regulated by the traffic rules, but there are decisions of the Berlin Court [once] (https://www.verkehrslexikon.de/Texte/Abbiegen9.php) and [two] (https://www.verkehrslexikon.de/Texte/Abbiegen1.php) that (1) when turning right you can choose any lane, (2) if there are several lanes turning right, the absolute advantage is turning right and (3) changing the lane during the turn is not a restructuring. Legal links on juris [once][right1], [two][right2], [three][right3]</p>

<p><strong>Lane selection when turning left, turning left from multiple lanes</strong>: not regulated by traffic rules. It is considered (by whom?) that the same rules apply as when turning right, i.e. you can choose any lane. Recommendation: from the extreme left turn to the extreme left, from the second lane - the right to choose the lane from the remaining ones.</p>

<p><strong>Markup arrows, a strip without arrows, Neutraler Fahrstreifen</strong>. Example: three lanes at an intersection in one direction, on the right arrow to the right, on the left arrow to the left, on the middle arrow not. The middle lane is the so-called Neutraler Fahrstreifen. Where can I go from the middle lane? The traffic lane is not regulated, to be more exact, you have no right to turn from this lane at all (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/97-9-abbiegen-wenden-und-rueckwaertsfahren">§9.1</a>), but it is considered (by whom? W.Bouska?) that from this lane it is possible to go in all directions, as on the next arrows. Such intersection configurations are present in Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart.</p>

<p><strong>Overtaking</strong>: the concept of overtaking is not regulated by the traffic rules, any advance (not necessarily “on the oncoming traffic lane”) is meant. By default, overtaking on the right side is prohibited (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/93-5-ueberholen">§5.1</a>), except:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Left-hand overtaking (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/93-5-ueberholen">§5.7</a>),</li>
  <li>Overtaking trams (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/93-5-ueberholen">§5.7</a>),</li>
  <li>movements in the dense stream (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/95-7-benutzung-von-fahrstreifen-durch-kraftfahrzeuge">§7.2</a>),</li>
  <li>traffic in the locality with the right to choose the lane (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/95-7-benutzung-von-fahrstreifen-durch-kraftfahrzeuge">§7.3</a>),</li>
  <li>in the presence of direction separating markings, e.g. on motorways (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/167-7a-abgehende-fahr-einfaedelungs-und-ausfaedelungsstreifen">§7a.1</a>), including in the acceleration lane,</li>
  <li>Overtaking at adjustable intersections,</li>
  <li>Cyclist overtaking other RTD participants (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/93-5-ueberholen">§5.8</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stop and Parking</strong>: In general, the list of places where stops and parking are prohibited differs significantly, so it is better to simply look at <a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/99-12-halten-und-parken">§12.1</a> and <a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/99-12-halten-und-parken">§12.3</a>. An interesting example is that stopping at an intersection is allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Buses</strong>: Overtaking of buses approaching a stop with an emergency stop is prohibited (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/179-20-oeffentliche-verkehrsmittel-und-schulbusse">§20.3</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Buses</strong>: Driving past a bus stopped at a dedicated bus stop is only possible with care, and this also applies to oncoming vehicles (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/179-20-oeffentliche-verkehrsmittel-und-schulbusse">20.1</a>).  If an emergency is activated for a stationary bus, it becomes “cautiously” a “stepping speed” and also acts as a meeting point (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/179-20-oeffentliche-verkehrsmittel-und-schulbusse">§20.4</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Buses</strong>: if a bus is available at a bus stop, pedestrians can cross the road and have the advantage (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/179-20-oeffentliche-verkehrsmittel-und-schulbusse">§20.2</a>, <a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/179-20-oeffentliche-verkehrsmittel-und-schulbusse">§20.4</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Reverse</strong>: reversing at junctions is permitted, as well as in other places except motorways (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/102-18-autobahnen-und-kraftfahrstrassen">§18.7</a>) and reversing on one-way streets, except for parking lots (not regulated by the StVO, but is [the decision of the Berlin Court] (https://www.verkehrslexikon.de/Texte/Rspr6405.php)</p>

<p><strong>Bikers</strong>: Left turn at intersections allowed (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/97-9-abbiegen-wenden-und-rueckwaertsfahren">§9.3</a>)</p>

<p>**” Transitions “Only unregulated pedestrian crossings outside the intersections are marked with a zebra, and at the intersections - just dotted markings. <a href="http://www.verwaltungsvorschriften-im-internet.de/bsvwvbund_26012001_S3236420014.htm">Part 4.1, Zu § 26 Fußgängerüberwege</a></p>

<p><strong>Towing</strong>: the emergency call must be activated on both vehicles (<a href="https://www.stvo.de/strassenverkehrsordnung/175-15a-abschleppen-von-fahrzeugen">§15a.3</a>), the driver behind the wheel of the towed vehicle is not required to have a licence ([link][towing1]).</p>
