    "content": "What is Niederlassungserlaubnis? A permanent residence permit (Niederlassungserlaubnis, permanent residence permit) is a permit that allows non-European Union (EU) citizens to live and work freely in Germany. It is also known as unbefristete Aufenthaltserlaubnis - an unlimited residence permit. You can get it after five years of stay in Germany with a D visa. Holders of Blau Karte can receive a B1 language certificate after 21 months or an A1 language certificate after 33 months. Working and living in the EU outside of Germany is not permitted, but it is possible to be absent from Germany for up to six months with prior agreement with the ABH. What is Daueraufenthalt-EU? A permanent residence permit in the EU (Daueraufenthalt-EU, European permanent residence permit) is a broader permit for residence and work, but already in the entire EU. It is issued after 5 years of contributions to the German pension fund, it is also unlimited, it allows absence from Germany for up to 11 months if there is a proven need (e.g. business trip). Read more about the list of required documents [here] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324281/pdf/) What’s the difference between Blaue Karte and Niederlassungserlaubnis? Unlike Blaue Karte, Niederlassungserlaubnis does not impose restrictions on employment. You can work as an employee, a freelancer, or you can not work, but live on savings. The requirement of Blaue Karte is a permanent place of work. To search for a new job - from 3 to 6 months. Allowed absence period in Germany for Niederlassungserlaubnis is 6 months, which can be extended by contacting [ABH] (ABH.md). If you move to another EU country, you need to apply to your local Blaue Karte locally, the exchange is not always possible, because each EU country has its own Blaue Karte requirements. With Niederlassungserlaubnis, you will have to go back to your home country and apply from there, but it will not prevent you from checking with the migration authority of the receiving country. Can I get an ALG-II (social) with Niederlassungserlaubnis? No How do I obtain an unlimited residence permit (Niederlassungserlaubnis) for Blaue Karte owners? Service page https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/326556/ Receiving experience (newer from above) Reference from the pension fund is made [by term] (https://www.eservice-drv.de/eTermin/dsire/step0.jsp) or simply by visiting any branch. It is also available free of charge by post ([service page] (https://www.eservice-drv.de/SelfServiceWeb/)). IMPORTANT: Ask your employer what information about your pension contributions has been sent to the pension fund. My employer sends it once a year, in January - for the previous year. May 2018 I don’t want to do it again, I did it all as it says below. I will specify only features. I have been working on the Blue Card in Berlin for more than 21 months and have passed the B1 exam. Recently I changed my job, I’m still on probation, but apparently it doesn’t matter. I sent all the documents as a scan to the post office at the end of March. I received a letter with the date of my visit to Ausländerbehörde at the end of May. Arbeitgeberbescheinigung had to do it twice when sending the docks and bring the fresh one to the term. If some documents are missing, they write letters by email, but send an invitation to Ausländerbehörde by regular mail. November 2017 On November 10, I sent scans of the following documents to IV_B3_GPF@labo.berlin.de Passport + Blaue Card + Fiktionsbescheinigung (green leaf) Filled in form Contract with the landlord with the cost and area of housing Registration confirmation [Meldebescheinigung] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120702/) Contract from the employer Confirmation from the employer (Arbeitgeberbescheinigung) that I am working and no dismissal is expected. Health insurance confirmation - I have a TC, received it electronically Confirmation of passing the course above the required level A certificate of payment to the pension fund (Rentenversicherungslauf) is obtained in Berlin through the SchnellService [here] (https://goo.gl/maps/V9qFQ8U7APm), go to the counter at the number, then go to the SchnellService Since it was November, the data in the pension only for January, so attached all pay slips from the beginning of the year We immediately received a letter saying that we accepted and asked not to worry anymore - due to the increased load the processing will take up to 3 months. On January 15, I was running out of Blaue Karte, so at the end of November I made another term for [extension of Blaue Karte] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324659/en/), at the same time asking through [contact form] (http://www.berlin.de/labo/willkommen-in-berlin/service/business-immigration-service/formular.309589.php) on the website about the list of documents required for extension. In response, the following list was sent promptly: Work contract Confirmation from the employer The last three pay slips “ Biometric Photo, 35x45 On January 15 came to extend Blaue Karte, an employee asked where the language certificate is, I said that after 33 months only A1, and no one gives it, she asked about the photo, I gave it to her. All communication was in German, so the ABH employee gave me a token card for payment and offered to pay 69 euros at once, explaining that I will be issued with Niederlassungserlaubnis. I went to the second floor, paid with an EC-card. I was summoned to the office and presented with a passport with glued permanent residence permit and a mark that I owned Blaue Karte. Thus, the process took 2 months. October 2017 On September 20th I sent copies of these documents by e-mail (IV_B3_GPF@labo.berlin.de) and mail (copies only): Passport, Blue Card, green insert Contract with the landlord Contract with the employer Confirmation from the employer (Arbeitgeberbescheinigung) Confirmation of pension contributions (without term and queue in 5 minutes at the branch) Pay Slips from the beginning of the calendar year Health insurance confirmation (requested from TK [online] (https://www.tk.de/tk/antraege-bescheinigungen/bescheinigungen/versicherungsbescheinigung/109498)) Confirmation of passing the course above the required level Passport photo Completed request form On September 22nd, an employee replied by e-mail with an offer to make an advance payment of €34.5 and send them a screenshot of the payment made. On October 6th the invitation for the 19th October in the office of ABH for business migrants came by e-mail On October 19, I went to the office (Manifesto) (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4511200/), [photo] (https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7458/26382257303_447bcffe39_b.jpg), where an employee took away my Blue Card and green insert, glued an unlimited residence permit into my passport and offered to pay the rest of the money through the bank within 2 weeks - everything took no more than 15 minutes. August 2017 Sent two packets of documents on the 18th: one by simple mail, the other by email. On the 21st I was replied to my email and told that they couldn’t open the zip archive for security reasons and asked me to use PDF, which I did. On the 24th we had a term in ABH: my wife needed to renew the visa. They told us that they could only extend by a year, as my visa expires in a year. We told the employee that I was in the process of obtaining a NE. To which she replied: Come and renew again as soon as you get the NE. With these words, we were asked to wait. In ~20 minutes we were called again and asked for my passport, blue card and appendix, and a photo. To the surprised glances she said that I will now be issued NE, and my wife will be extended visa for three years. I was asked to wait again. They called me in ~30 minutes. Everyone was glued new visas into the passport. I’m NE, my wife is three years old, and my child is under 16 years old. Thus, the process took me 6 days. July 2017 12.07 sends 2 packages of documents to ABH: by mail (registered letter) and to IV_B3_GPF@labo.berlin.de 13.07 answered the question on one of the attachments from the personal email of the ABBH employee. Thus, I immediately had an email from an employee who is considering my case 9.08 wrote to the employee whether everything is ok with the documents and whether there is anything else to be done. She answered the next day, all right, expect 6.09 was on an ABH term on a different subject, and she also asked me how my papers were doing. An ABH employee sadly showed me a pocketbook with a list of people who had applied for NOT and said that now only the June ones are being considered. At the same time, she said that in 2016, there should be pension statements instead of paisley. I went to the pension office on 26.09, they certainly don’t have any data for this year, they will be in February next year 26.09 wrote to the contact form on the ABH website with a polite question about the status of my case 27.09 a letter from the personal email of an ABH employee with the term “NOT at 11.10” came in. The term should have been updated with an employer’s certificate, bk and passport (no paisley). 11.10 have made the passport-not in the passport :slightly_smiling_face: Documents could not be sent by mail, and the answer was that everything ok with the documents came by email before the paper letter reached the ABH. They seem to read the appeals through the contact form. They don’t respond to them, but apparently this has stimulated my Beratorin to accelerate. Kicking them in person or by email is not particularly effective To receive NE came with a new foreign passport (not the one that was in the package of documents for filing), there were no questions, glued immediately there Blue Card not left. I asked if it was possible that an Ausländerbehörde employee said that two Auftenhaltstitels could not have at the same time. This is not the case, there is a court decision and precedents for obtaining a NE in addition to the Blue Card August 2016 The entire list of documents: Pass mit Blauer Karte und Arbeitserlaubnis (grünes Zusatzblatt) Arbeitsvertrag Arbeitgeberbescheinigung über die aktuelle Beschäftigung Gehaltsnachweise der letzten 6 Monate Nachweis über die Krankenversicherung Nachweis der Deutschen Rentenversicherung über die Einzahlung von 21 Beiträgen Mietvertrag (mit Miethöhe) Nachweis über einen Sprachtest B1 (Zertifikat) 1 aktuelles biometrisches Foto Verwaltungsgebühren 85 Euro Submitted after 21 months in Germany, 5 August 2016. I arrived on 25 October 2014. I sent an email saying that I am 21 months old and I want NE. I was told in the mail that they had accepted my application (a regular email was right for them) and that they would contact me when the time came. They didn’t ask for any documents, just to wait. I had to wait for a real long time (3+ months), I wrote an email a couple of times, to which I received answers that your application is not considered yet because of the large influx of volunteers. During the waiting time I passed the German at B1 in Humboldt Institut, which is located on NordBahnhof. The exam is not hard. Came email to this Mon, November 7, when I was still on vacation in Kiev. Thanks to me just that day and I flew back to Germany. They invited me to come in on the 10th day (today) at 10:30 and wrote to me what number to call. They also listed the docks to bring. The language certificate was one of them. Being already in the waiting room of the new building of the ABH (Keplerstr. 2, 10589 Berlin) at 10:30 p.m. they called in the docks, gathered them and asked to wait. At the beginning of the 12th they returned the passport with a visa type sticker, which is the NE. After asking to leave me and BlaueKarte, they said that they could not hold two residence permits at the same time. I explained that some BC buns I liked better than in NE, such as absence from the country for one year with retained status. They showed that in NE there is an inscription that it is redesigned from the BC and assured that all the BC buns for me should continue to operate. Once upon a time in 2016 or earlier With regard to the Niederlassungserlaubnis for blue card holders, the following experience was gained today. The term was sent to you as early as 3 months ago. At the same time, I now have 33 months of experience (with the latest reference from the pension reserve) and have a B1 certificate for sehr gut, so I pass through all the requirements. But from the moment I received the term I managed to change my job and at the moment I am on trial. For this reason, I was initially refused, saying that they agreed to give me everything from my old job, that now I have to wait 6 months to apply again and that I did not have to change my job at all. To the remark that I have a probationary period of only 3 months and half of it has already passed, and that about the probationary period in the requirements is not written at all, they said that it is not important, still under some conditions they have to wait for 6 months, but nevertheless all the updated documents were taken away and asked to wait. While waiting, I was thinking over the strategy that it was necessary to demand an official refusal from them, to find out their names, etc., and then for some reason I decided that they have no legal grounds to refuse, because I satisfy all the requirements, so they will now think about it and give me everything. With this thought, when I was invited in half an hour, I went into the office. Indeed, the lady tells me that they consulted with a colleague and despite my probationary period decided that since I am such a good specialist, they give me the permanent residence permit. They took the fingerprints again, told me to come for a new card in 6 weeks. However, when asked if I could keep my current Blaue Karte, they said that the new one was also a blame card, only with unlimited validity. At home, I read that if they suspected that I could be left without a livelihood, they had the right to refuse even if all the requirements in the permanent residence were met, so I was lucky. Therefore, be careful with the change of job when applying for permanent residence. more post about the experience of getting NE [CoML in Germany in two years?

The office address has changed for the Blaue Karte holders, now you have to go to Keplerstr. 2, 10589 Berlin, 4th floor Not bad [a set of questions and answers] (http://viza-v-germaniyu.ru/rabota-v-germanii/golubaya-karta-blue-card) on blue card. FAQ on various legal statuses and related issues (Blaue Karte, NE, Daueraufenthalt-EU) [Term in Berlin] (https://formular.berlin.de/jfs/findform?shortname=OTVBerlin&amp;formtecid=4&amp;areashortname=LABO) [Term on Bluecard in Munich] (https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/terminvereinbarung_abh.html?cts=1080627) When you change the address, the notification is not necessary, it makes sense if you need the current address on the card itself. In this case it is possible to go without the term (it is possible to go and on the term too), to take the ticket, do a sticker in the same day, free of charge. (They say they change it in Service Point, on the EG floor, without queues, if someone manages to get a work contract and change it with Blaue Karte there, confirm that I couldn’t do it, it seems as soon as students are served there). In case of a mistake on the card (passport number does not match, etc.) the card will be replaced. The old card stays in your hands until a new one is issued and is replaced free of charge. You should have a photo with you or make it on the spot, in a photo machine. At change of the employer during probationary period (notice period of 2 weeks), if there is no possibility to reserve the term on a site it is possible to write on an e-mail IV_B3_GPF@labo.berlin.de then employees of ABH will send the term by the return letter. You can change the employer at any time. The first 2 years on Blaue Karte it is desirable to inform ABH before changing jobs. According to the law, it is necessary to obtain a permit from the ABH to change the employer before the change, if it occurs in the first two years of validity of Blaue Karte. I was told this information on this phone number BAMF +49 30-1815-1111, they speak English, will tell me the answer to any question concerning Blaue Karte. We need to bring a new signed contract with a salary greater than the minimum required. It is necessary to do it within 3 months after termination of the previous contract. Freelancing is possible for the first 2 years, but in combination with the main job. You can work remotely for an employer from other countries, but you can also live and pay taxes in Germany. For example, you can live in Berlin and work for an Austrian company - you do not need to reissue a blue card. TIP: It is better to go without the term on Monday or Tuesday, early in the morning (1-2 hours before opening). TIP: if it lights up with a visit, you can “catch” the term for earlier terms, someone refuses the term, and it becomes available, with great luck so you can catch the term on the next week even. TIP: if you suspect that you will be changing the card - take pictures. TIP: It’s better to replace the card not during a job change, or take the work contracts with you to confirm that you are employed, the ABH may have information that you are unemployed, and therefore there may be nuances with the change of card. If the wife is going to study the language, it is highly recommended to ask for a referral to [integration courses] (https://github.com/ru-de/faq/blob/master/%D0%AF%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8B.md#Интеграционные-курсы-языковые-курсы) Photos TIP: Always take photos of all the people who go to ABH with you. Photos can be taken in the ABH itself, look for photo machines. In ABH on Keplerstr. 2 no photo machine, but it is on the nearest U-Bahn wanderings Mierendorffplatz or S-Bahn station Jungfernheide. If there is a passport photo in electronic form, the cheapest thing to do is to make a template for passport photos 10x15 cm in one of the free online services, and then print this template as a regular photo 10x15 cm in a photo booth (DM, Rossmann) for 35 cents. Unlimited residence permit Can be obtained after 21 months when submitting a B1 language certificate, or after 33 months when submitting an A1 certificate.

A: Depending on the country, it is likely that your rights are only valid for the first 6 months, then they will need to be exchanged Q: Is there a difference in the rules of my country and Germany? A: Most likely, it is recommended to go to driving school and listen to theoretical lectures even if you change your license. Details and grey areas of StVO are also described in the special section Getting your license As in any other cultural country, in Germany you need a driving licence (Führerschein) to drive a car and other vehicles. Hereinafter the default is Category B, i.e. conventional vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of 3.5 t or less, possibly with a trailer of up to 750 kg. Learning from scratch If you come to Germany without a driver’s license, but want to get it, you will have to study “in full program”, i.e. to go to the mandatory theory and roll back the mandatory practical hours, which usually pours out about 2-3 times more money than the exchange (~ 2500 euros vs. ~ 800) The exchange of rights Rights issued outside Germany are only valid in Germany for the first 6 months after the first residence permit (Anmeldung) and then must be exchanged for German rights. Please note that not in Germany the driver’s license is valid, i.e. nobody forbids you to travel to Poland or Austria, rent a car there and travel to the rest of the European Union under national law. Requirements to replace the rights of different states to German can be found [here] (http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/fachspezifisch/HA-III/Dokumente/Fuehrerschein/Staatenliste-Umschreibung-ausl-FS.pdf), but in general the situation is such that the holders of the rights of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus (as of 2017) need to pass both practical and theoretical exams, the only relaxation is exemption from the mandatory hours of theory and practice. Replacement process: Sign up for the driving school, get a paper stamped by the school Take a first aid course and a vision test Submit a set of documents to confirm your rights Wait 1-6 weeks after the confirmation is received, sign up for the theoretical exam Waiting for the theoretical exam, come on in. You sign up for a practical exam Waiting for a practical exam, come on in. You get the desired plastic Practice shows that most of the time is spent waiting for terms and exams.

Recommended courses in Berlin: 1 at рус англ нем language and 2, it is easier to get the term for more convenient days and cheaper. Certificate of vision test (0.7 and better - without glasses, less than 0.7 - you need glasses and will need a note in your rights), the validity period - two years.

You may be asked if you would like to submit to TUV or Dekra (10.2017, Munich - not asked). No principal difference is noticed, but if asked, it is recommended to choose TUV. The testing period varies from a few days to 16 weeks, but is usually 4-6 weeks. The original driver’s license is taken away when you submit it. You can then return your license, when you receive and hand over the documents, you just need to ask for it. You can pick up after 1-2 weeks of verification by signing up for the term again. As of 2017, Munich gives without questions, the main thing is to come to the second term with a passport and a paper confirming that your rights have been accepted. Return of national rights But it happens that a Fahrerlaubnisbehörde employee begins to claim that the rights do not come back. Until now, no one has found a way to prove him wrong (except to go to another employee). It is recommended to make a copy, which will be useful for car rental in the future. If you are not convinced not to take away your national rights, you should write [free form letter] (files/DrivingLicenseReturnTemplate.md) asking for it back. UPD: Munich. September 2017. When issuing new German rights, the Ukrainian ones with the sticker that the German ones were issued were also given away. UPD: Berlin. May 2018. A year and a half after the exchange, he re-applied for the return of his Belarusian rights. I returned on the grounds that I had a category “A” there and I want to ride a motorcycle in my home country. I applied through the window, issued a ticket, received and returned the rights within 10 minutes. Everyone speaks German, except for one guy, to whom I was sent. A template of such a return application in connection with an additional category] (files/Driving_licence_back.pdf). UPD: Berlin. March 2018. When submitting the application, the original rights were not taken away. According to experience and information from Berlin acquaintances, no one’s rights are taken away from them when they apply in Berlin. UPD: Berlin. April 2018. He came to take away his rights after passing the exam and asked me to leave my national rights. The guy said that national rights are returned only if they have a category that is not in the German rights category. In other words, if the national rights have categories B and C, but only B, the national rights can be retained. UPD: Hamburg. August 2017. In response to a letter written as above, [response] comes (files/russishe_fuererherscein_zuruck.jpg), you can’t have two rights at once. Theory The theoretical examination consists of 30 questions of different degrees of “importance” (different number of “points”), including video questions and variable questions (the essence is the same, but the picture, the color of the car or the pedestrian’s sex change). The total number of questions is about 1300, excluding variations. The theoretical examination is available in 12 languages, including Russian and English. The choice of answers is always multiple, at least one option is always correct. To pass the exam successfully, you need to score no more than 10 “points” (more errors - more points), and two “five-point” errors are not allowed. When submitting the theory, you must provide confirmation from Bürgeramt and the driving school. You can pay the fee for the theory on site. The result of the examination is immediately communicated to you on site and a paper confirmation of the examination is also issued. If you fail, you will have to try again after two weeks at the earliest. You can find the place where you can take the exam at [TUV] (https://www.tuv.com/de/deutschland/locations/locationsglobal.jsp?location=Berlin&amp;radius=10&amp;topic=18880) or [Dekra] (https://www.dekra.de/de-de/standorte/). However, it is better to ask the instructor for a list of the latest information for your case, because not all offices provide the full range of services. Training programs: https://www.fuehrerschein-lernsystem.de/main.asp is a handy website, where you can show a variety of questions, you can mark “difficult” questions, categorization, mobile applications, comments on questions. You can answer 300 questions free of charge, and the paid version ranges from 6 euros for 1 month to 40 euros for an unlimited period of time. But only in German (you can try to translate Google in English). https://ru.fuehrerschein-bestehen.de - multilingual program, from 25 (1 month) to 50 euros (3 months). http://app.fahrschulcard.de/ - software from driving schools, there is Russian, look for логин пароль with friends (according to the available information, accounts are valid for 2 years after registration) or buy from the school (about 70 euros) http://www.fahren-lernen.de/ - Also a good program. Online registration is not possible, you need to go to any driving school, pay for registration to get the name / password **” What language should I use to pass the theory? It is logical to assume that if you know German at a sufficient level, it is better to pass in the original - you can be sure that there are no errors in translation. As for the Russian language for theory, in general, there are no problems. There are only a handful of questions where the meaning of the answer choices changes because of the translation, but such questions are literally a couple from the whole list. Specific examples: 1.2.19-113 and 2.5.01-010. Stopway calculation formulas Among the options there are many different questions about braking, stopping and reactionary pathways. The formula is used for this: Practice The practical exam lasts ~45 minutes and includes technical questions before starting the journey (how to check the oil level, where the parking lights are switched on, how to check the tires, etc.), traffic in the city (including zones 30) and traffic on the autobahn. One of our brother’s most important and unusual requirements on the exam is to turn your head, the so-called Schulterblick. It is not enough to check the situation on the mirrors, it is necessary to turn your head to the left by 90 degrees (beginning of movement, turns and rearrangements to the left, etc.) and to the right over your shoulder, looking through the window of the rear right door (turns and rearrangements to the right, etc.), so that the examiner sees that you are turning your head.

Only for new rights, and depending on the land. When you change your license, you have to take back your old license. The examiner does not have the right to do so, so they issue new rights and take away old ones from the office. New rights in NRW can be granted on the spot. In Berlin, a pink piece of paper is given out on the spot after it has been handed over, which replaces the rights in Germany. Plastic rights will be ready in 2-3 weeks.

Promotion code 51MpOVbv Your car Buying a car As everywhere else, the basic fundamental questions of “what kind of car?”, “new or second-hand”, “private or dealer/repurchase? If you have to answer the first two questions on your own, you can write about the bids in Germany separately. Most of the ads are bribes, so-called handlers (Händler). What’s good about them is that they have to provide a car warranty. Usually, this warranty is a year in which you can complain for the first half of the year and it is up to the dealer to prove that the fault is yours (which is almost unrealistic), and for the second half of the year you have to prove that the fault is the dealer’s (which is also almost unrealistic) fault. Therefore, you can consider that the warranty is six months. Also, some dealers may offer an extended warranty, perhaps for an additional fee. And yes, all this applies to used cars. If you buy a car from a private person (privat), by default it does not provide any warranty, and also in a standard remote control it can be specified explicitly. Regardless of the seller, pay attention to the TUV. The ideal option is if the TUV was made recently (1-2-3 months ago) or if the seller agrees to make a new one when selling. If the TUV expires in six months and the seller refuses to make a new one - it is better to think twice, there are all chances to get a “bucket”, not allowed to move. There is no single form of DPK here, but on site sites and on the ADAC site ([link] (https://www.adac.de/der-adac/rechtsberatung/musterkaufvertraege-musterformulare/vorlagen/)) you can find standard contract templates for all cases of life. It is interesting to note that the local contract contains much more details than at home. For example, here the seller signs under the current mileage and claims like “no taxi use, no damage, no car accident”. Accordingly, if it turns out that the seller deliberately kept silent about the “dark” moments in the history of the car, that is, all chances for a refund and termination of the contract (consult with lawyers!) At the conclusion of the contract it is standard to pay an “advance payment” on the spot (100-500 euros), which, of course, should be noted in the contract. The main part of the amount the seller can ask to transfer to his account, to agree or to insist on the transfer of cash - your business. In any case, do not transfer a cent in any way until the contract is signed in two copies. Each dealer usually has red numbers - you can ride the car with them and feel the car. If you are not allowed to ride the car, then, as everywhere, it is better to think about it 10 times. The largest site http://www.mobile.de/, private ads there as well. There is also http://autoscout24.de. A lot of dealers are scattered around the city, usually closer to industrial zones, selling used/commissioned cars. Runs are also twisted. Some give a guarantee, some do not. In general, everything is as everywhere, without a person who understands the cars, you can get. Yes, and with a person, too, roulette. Buying guide http://www.tupa-germania.ru/avtomobil/pokupka-avtomobilja.html Car registration Registration of a car or registration is called Kfz-Zulassung. Unlike Russia, where the license plate is tied to the car, here the license plates are more tied to the owner, so in most cases, when buying a used car, the seller will keep the existing numbers for himself, and you will have to make new ones when registering. But keeping license plates is also possible, but only in case of sales in the same region (pruf?), you can try to agree with the seller. However, in most cases you will have to get new numbers (or use your own from a previous car). If you wish, you can choose any of the available license plate numbers (wunschkennzeichen). This will increase the cost of registration by about 12.8 euros. To do this, it is advisable to reserve the desired number online before you register (see the links to the regional pages below) and take a confirmation printout of the selected numbers with you, but you can also say so at the time of registration. The following documents are required for vehicle registration: Passport (Personalausweis, Reisepass) In some cases, the place of residence (Meldebestätigung über den Wohnsitz) of the person to be registered may be required (Munich, 2018 - not required); Two green papers about the Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil I and Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil II (if the car is new, only Teil II); A technical inspection report, also known as a TUV or Hauptuntersuchung (not required for new vehicles); A confirmation from the insurance company that they are ready to take you in for insurance (Kfz-Haftpflichtversicherung). Usually it is just a code, and it is enough; SEPA-mandate for payment of car tax. Here] (https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Web/DE/Service/Apps_Rechner/KfzRechner/KfzRechner.html) you can calculate how much you will get; Application for registration; Old license plates (Kennzeichenschilder), if the car was picked up with them; New license plates (you can make on site in a dozen offices near the institution or order in advance online, will be somewhat cheaper); For electric cars and plug-in hybrids (obtaining “electro” numbers) manufacturer’s certificate (issued in the cabin). After the procedure is completed, you should receive it: New certificate of registration (Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil I); Enter your details on the supplementary sheet (Zulassungsbescheinigungen Teil II), if necessary; Room stickers: regional stickers for both and a rear inspection sticker (when changing the number) Umweltplakette - “eco-sticker”, the sticker corresponding to the environmental class of the car, must be glued to the lower right side of the windscreen. The total cost of registration may vary from region to region, but can be based on ~60 euros: 30 euros registration, 20 euros room pairing, 12 euros choice of any number, 6 euros Umweltplakette. Registration of the car is also possible by proxy. You can download the power of attorney form [here] (https://www.adac.de/-/media/adac/pdf/jze/musterkaufvertraege/vollmacht-zulassung-fahrzeuges.pdf). Also remember that you must notify the state and make changes to the car registration documents when moving (if you change the region, you can also change your license plate number). UPD: Berlin. April 2019. The price for printing a number pair in Liechtenstein (Kfz-Zulassungsbehörde-Lichtenberg) is 17.50 EUR.

As of April 2018, it is also not possible to make the term online, you need to come to the station (or call) and sign up. Inspection Every 2 years you need to do a car inspection (for new cars the first inspection is done after 3 years). Two organizations - TUV and DEKRA - are involved in the technical inspection of the car. The technical condition of the vehicle and emissions of harmful substances are checked. The price of the question is 92 euros (TUV, 2017). It is also possible to apply to an auto workshop, which will deal with this issue and will be able to immediately eliminate the problems that have arisen. Find out when the maintenance can be carried out by using the poster on the back number: A year in the middle, 12 hours across, a month. For the delay of more than 2 months a fine is due, and the Internet also writes that the insurance ceases to operate with the overdue maintenance. There is a lot of information on the Internet about the preparation for the inspection, but not badly told in the video of Denis Ram: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q30u66fJrs. The main ones are absence of through rust, chips on the glass, work of lighting equipment (as well as correction of headlights’ inclination angle), brakes, suspension condition, absence of oil leaks, work of belts. And of course - each tuning requires its own documents. You can come to the station and ask for a quick inspection - it is not expensive, and can help to make well-considered decisions on repair, if necessary. My experience - having realized that I had missed the maintenance for 2 months (I misread the poster), I made a term for the next morning. For this purpose, I used the website https://www.tuv.com/de/deutschland/pk/auto_und_verkehr/pruefstellen/suche.jsp. When I arrived half an hour earlier (just in time for the opening), I asked if I should wait. The expert said that I could stop by. The first thing he did was connect the diagnostic equipment, check the gas emissions, the operation of the lighting equipment, the level adjustment. Then I checked the work of brakes, handbrake. Then I picked up, looked at the suspension, stains, brake disks - put down the car and glued a new plaque :) Also printed a document with the results of the inspection and tips for use. It took me about 20-30 minutes to print. Insurance (KFZ-Versicherung) As in many other countries, every driver in Germany is required to have third party insurance (local compulsory motor TPL insurance, Kfz-Haftpflicht). In addition to the minimum insurance, there is also the so-called Teilkasko and Vollkasko (CASCO). Teilkasko usually only covers theft, explosion, storm and other force majeure, while Vollkasko covers any damage to your vehicle. Germany also has a bonus-malus system (Schadenfreiheitsklasse, SF-class). But, unlike unification of the discount at the state level (for example, as in the Russian Federation), here each insurance company can set the amount of the discount independently within certain limits. Also, each insurance company has its own algorithms for recalculating the class after the insured event (the table is called Rückstufungstabelle) If you have had experience of accident-free driving in your home country, some German insurance companies allow you to read it out in Germany. For example, here is [instruction] (http://asdcode.de/blog/de_bureaucracy/64.html) for HUK24. All insurance companies in Germany provide insurance for all countries that participate in the Green Card program as part of the regular insurance. At the same time, if you travel within the EU, you do not need any additional documents, but if you go to Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Moldova - you need to ask your insurance company for this very Green Card, usually it is sent free of charge. But even in the EU it is recommended to have a green card with you to avoid embarrassment and problems. How to choose an insurance policy? You can go to check24.de and compare options, and HUK24 is also popular. As noted above, it is recommended to pay attention not only to the total cost, but also to the amount of discounts on SF and the change of class after the insured events. “Electro” numbers (Elektrokennzeichen) “Electro” numbers are issued for electric vehicles and hybrid plug-ins, provided that the CO2 emissions are no more than 50 g/km or no less than 40 km of electric traction range (detailed requirements in the description of the service). The numbers differ from the ordinary numbers by the presence of an “E” at the end of the number, e.g. “B AB 4999E”. The basic number combination can be selected in the same way as the normal number, in which case the “E” literature will be added to the selected combination when registering. “Electro numbers may provide some advantages to owners, depending on the municipality, such as parking or dedicated line traffic. As of April 2019, there are no advantages in Berlin. Purchase of spare parts (Exist equivalent) https://www.kfzteile24.de/ Parking In Berlin (Cologne, possibly in other cities, too) it is possible to park in your residential area for 20.5 euros in 2 years. It is called Bewohnerparkausweis. Service page [here] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/121721/). Difference in rules Disclaimer 0: This text is not legally relevant, do not refer to it if you go to court. Disclaimer 1: The difference is marked by a comparison of the RF PDD and StVO. When writing, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the 2016-2017 version of the Russian version of the PDDD. Disclaimer 2: references to court decisions are made to public resources, almost all the topics to which references are made are ambiguous and lengthy discussions are possible, court decisions are usually much more than one. What is written here is food for thought and key thoughts that you can look for details rather than knowingly correct statements. Disclaimer 3: We remind you that the default is Category B, i.e. conventional cars with a maximum permissible weight of no more than 3.5 tons, possibly with a trailer of up to 750 kg. Before we move on to the list of various points, we would like to note a few general ideas that can be traced in the German traffic police: Most of the city area is often a “zone 30”, a residential area. It is recommended that pedestrians, children and blind intersections are monitored. The presence of a large number of unregulated intersections without established priority signs. This is particularly noticeable in the above-mentioned zones 30. Accordingly, it is recommended that you never forget the “interference on the right”. Left turn: Left turn should be made using the right pass §9.4 Circle movement, priority: Contrary to popular belief, the presence of the 215 sign (“Circle movement”) itself does not give an advantage to vehicles moving in a circle. On the other hand, the German “guest” also prescribes that the sign 205 (Leave the road) or 209 (Only to the right) be placed at roundabouts. Part 3, Zu Zeichen 215 Kreisverkehr Roundabout, turntable: The use of a turntable at the entrance to roundabout is explicitly prohibited (§8.1a). Main road area: Sign 306 (“Main road”) ends with only 307 (“end of main road”), 205 (“Step aside”) and 206 (“Stop”). In other words, junctions do not cancel the main road sign (Part 5, Zu den Zeichen 306 und 307 Vorfahrtstraße und Ende der Vorfahrtstraße) **” Traffic lights If the arrow on the optional traffic light section lights up, this ensures that your trajectory will not intersect with anyone (i.e. other vehicles and pedestrians will definitely be red). §37.1, Grüner Pfeil Traffic lights: if there is a green plate arrow (at the top right of the traffic light, next to the red light; sign 720), turn right to red (as in the U.S.), stopping in front of the traffic light and giving way to all the way. §37.1, Grünpfeil Priority: in case of narrowing of roads and end of the lane, vehicles moving along the main lane are obliged to allow the vehicle to enter from the lane that ends (on the principle of “lightning”). That is, the fact that you drive straight ahead and do not make manoeuvres does not give you an advantage over those who run out of lanes (§7.4) Lane selection: A settlement has freedom of lane selection (freie Fahrstreifenwahl) regardless of the total number of lanes (§7.3) Choice of lane when turning right, turning right from several lanes: not regulated by the traffic rules, but there are decisions of the Berlin Court [once] (https://www.verkehrslexikon.de/Texte/Abbiegen9.php) and [two] (https://www.verkehrslexikon.de/Texte/Abbiegen1.php) that (1) when turning right you can choose any lane, (2) if there are several lanes turning right, the absolute advantage is turning right and (3) changing the lane during the turn is not a restructuring. Legal links on juris [once][right1], [two][right2], [three][right3] Lane selection when turning left, turning left from multiple lanes: not regulated by traffic rules. It is considered (by whom?) that the same rules apply as when turning right, i.e. you can choose any lane. Recommendation: from the extreme left turn to the extreme left, from the second lane - the right to choose the lane from the remaining ones. Markup arrows, a strip without arrows, Neutraler Fahrstreifen. Example: three lanes at an intersection in one direction, on the right arrow to the right, on the left arrow to the left, on the middle arrow not. The middle lane is the so-called Neutraler Fahrstreifen. Where can I go from the middle lane? The traffic lane is not regulated, to be more exact, you have no right to turn from this lane at all (§9.1), but it is considered (by whom? W.Bouska?) that from this lane it is possible to go in all directions, as on the next arrows. Such intersection configurations are present in Munich, Nuremberg and Stuttgart. Overtaking: the concept of overtaking is not regulated by the traffic rules, any advance (not necessarily “on the oncoming traffic lane”) is meant. By default, overtaking on the right side is prohibited (§5.1), except: Left-hand overtaking (§5.7), Overtaking trams (§5.7), movements in the dense stream (§7.2), traffic in the locality with the right to choose the lane (§7.3), in the presence of direction separating markings, e.g. on motorways (§7a.1), including in the acceleration lane, Overtaking at adjustable intersections, Cyclist overtaking other RTD participants (§5.8). Stop and Parking: In general, the list of places where stops and parking are prohibited differs significantly, so it is better to simply look at §12.1 and §12.3. An interesting example is that stopping at an intersection is allowed. Buses: Overtaking of buses approaching a stop with an emergency stop is prohibited (§20.3). Buses: Driving past a bus stopped at a dedicated bus stop is only possible with care, and this also applies to oncoming vehicles (20.1). If an emergency is activated for a stationary bus, it becomes “cautiously” a “stepping speed” and also acts as a meeting point (§20.4) Buses: if a bus is available at a bus stop, pedestrians can cross the road and have the advantage (§20.2, §20.4) Reverse: reversing at junctions is permitted, as well as in other places except motorways (§18.7) and reversing on one-way streets, except for parking lots (not regulated by the StVO, but is [the decision of the Berlin Court] (https://www.verkehrslexikon.de/Texte/Rspr6405.php) Bikers: Left turn at intersections allowed (§9.3) **” Transitions “Only unregulated pedestrian crossings outside the intersections are marked with a zebra, and at the intersections - just dotted markings. Part 4.1, Zu § 26 Fußgängerüberwege Towing: the emergency call must be activated on both vehicles (§15a.3), the driver behind the wheel of the towed vehicle is not required to have a licence ([link][towing1]).

Beginning on 1 January 2017, cyclists must follow the signals of a bicycle traffic light when crossing an intersection, and if there is no such signal, then the car traffic light. Pedestrian traffic lights for pedestrians, wheelchair users and children under 7 years of age only. In case of noncompliance - fine 60 euros, in case of accident - 180 euros. Sources: de, ru. Varieties of bicycle traffic lights: (top-down) - red, yellow, green: green - you can go. Yellow - you can’t go, you can finish the maneuver. red - you can’t go, you can’t finish the maneuver. (top-down) - red, red, green (for color blind people): Only middle red - you can’t go, you can finish the maneuver. Two red ones - you can’t go, you can’t finish the maneuver. You should also pay attention to the arrows at the traffic lights. Sometimes, the traffic lights are only for turning left, and you can always go straight ahead. There are crossroads with two traffic lights - for turning and for driving straight ahead. It is highly recommended to watch the cars turning to the right, as they can slip through, go to the bicycle lane for maneuvering.

It is easier to pre-register and install the application. Rental service “Lidl-bike” Service from a large supermarket chain [Lidl] (https://www.lidl.de/) in partnership with the DB [Call a Bike] project (https://www.callabike-interaktiv.de/).

Quite a few stations around the city Ability to leave your bike at any major intersection (at extra cost) Some personal experience of use (situation as of May 2017): Quite often the bike that is marked on the map is not in place quite often a bike, which is free and marked on the map or on the station, may be busy (someone forgot to press the return button and just threw it away), or just inaccessible for unknown reasons Some people leave a bike hire in their yard and close the door, apparently to make it easier to leave in the morning - if the point on the map is not near the road, it is likely that the bike is in the yard At the stations, there is usually one bicycle that cannot be taken. It has a Station sign on it. It’s a little misleading, like a bicycle is standing there and there’s nothing to ride on. Despite the recent launch (May 8), some bikes do not have a seat beyond the middle - it seems to stick - check your bike before you ride At bikes of 3 speeds, 1st I do not know at all for whom to ride on 3rd ride in a stream of cyclists it is necessary to twist pedals very diligently, and on many bikes on 3rd speed sometimes scroll pedals be prepared to carry wet napkins with you, as bikes could be stained with water, bird droppings and other cyclists’ dirty hands. Sometimes bikes drop, and they are dirty On average, it takes 10 minutes from “I want to ride a bike” to “I’m riding” to find a bike that is available and not busy. That is, a quick way to get to work is not to count on There are almost never enough bicycles at the stations, and apparently they are not enough in general, not enough. Bicycles are most often located in alleys, so you have to go and look for them. If you need 1 bike - not a big problem, but when you need 2 - uncomfortable. And yes, you can take up to 4 bikes per account, but bonuses such as 30min are free to apply only to the first the mobile app isn’t very handy, but it’s user-friendly.

This may be useful if you need to prove that you did not steal it. You can buy a new bicycle on lease from your employer if it has a contract with the [JobRad] service (https://www.jobrad.org/). This is done in installments of 36 months and the monthly payments are deducted from the gross salary, which reduces the amount of mandatory payments to the employer. They have a 40% or more benefit for the employee on their website (in fact, 10-30%), but [there are nuances] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fahrrad/comments/c7xx4l/jobrad/esx4uix/): You have to pay a monthly tax of 0.5% on the “benefit” of such a transaction. The price includes mandatory insurance (which is not bad). There are maintenance and inspection requirements. The bicycle will most likely need to be redeemed when the employer changes. The price in the shop must be at least 749 euros. Used [Local Online flea markets] [Stores, %20 discounts, %20 bonuses.md#local Online flea markets] When buying a bike, the seller can write a handwritten confirmation of purchase with the date and model of the bike to prove that the bike has not been stolen by you. An overview of what to look out for when buying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vurwRzZ4K7A (for bikes with cassette switches). For bikes with planetary bushings, it is sufficient to check the function of the rear brake. The speed change and the duration of the inertial rotation of the wheel (should be more than 10 seconds, there should be clicks) are clear. A city bike with a planetary hub and bottle dynamo can be purchased for ~50 euros, with a Nabendynamo for ~120 euros. In some cities there are free (with voluntary donations) bicycle workshops, designed primarily for refugees - they have tools, repairs need to be done yourself. Equipment Bicycles must have front and rear brakes. The penalty is 40 euros, but it is 10 days to fix it - you have to show the bike to the police and then the fine will be cancelled. In the dark it is necessary to have the rear red and front white lights. Both must have a StVzo mark, i.e. they must comply with local lighting standards. Recently, it is allowed to have battery-powered and removable lanterns. It is also advisable to wear a green reflective vest like a motorist’s. Safety Look carefully at what you fasten your bike to and how you fasten it! Check the parking post or frame, whether it is securely embedded and whether there is any tape on it, as there may be a covered cut, and then even a lock for 100€ won’t help. Be sure to fasten your bike behind the frame, not the wheel. You should also not leave your bike outdoors overnight, even if it is securely fastened. It is strongly recommended that you do not leave your bicycle overnight in public places**, such as metro stops, train stations, etc. It is better to spend a couple of Euros on the bus than to bite your elbows and look for a new bike after the weekend. If you have to leave the bike overnight, it is better to have an old and rusty bike, which will not be sorry, but it will be enough to get to the bus stop. It can also save you from stealing the place where you fasten your bike. For example, if you have a choice of fastening your bicycle a few meters from the front door or 50-100 meters from it, but it will be a busy crossroads and cafes across the street, then I strongly advise you to second (from personal experience ;-), and it’s about daylight hours). If the bike is new and expensive, I advise you to use insurance. There are cases with unsuccessful experience of appealing to the police on the issue of searching for stolen bicycles: Having written a statement and reported that the bicycles had been stolen from under the house and that there was a camera there, the police said that we should find the owner of the camera and ask for a video and provide it to the police… As we understood, the chances of our bikes being returned are super minimal. There is also a known case of bicycle theft directly from the public Fahradzimmer house where the owner lives. The theft was discovered in the morning, i.e. the theft was committed at night. The bicycle was fastened with a simple lock of a low security level. The theft of a bicycle If your bicycle has been stolen and you have documents for the frame of the fork at и или with their number, you can register the theft at [Polizei Online] (https://www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de/). You also need to register if your insured bicycle is stolen. The insurance company requires a case number, as well as proof of ownership of the bicycle and the value of the stolen property.",

It currently stands at EUR 194 per month (from 1 July 2019 at EUR 204 per month) for the first and second child, EUR 200 per third child (from 1 July 2019 to 210) and EUR 225 per child (from 1 July 2019 to 235). From 2016 onwards, a tax number is required for its issuance. Generally, the allowance is paid for up to 18 years, sometimes it can be extended to 25 years. You can apply for the allowance at your local Familienkasse office. You will need to submit your application: Application for benefits (available in English) Appendix for each child (available in English) Haushaltsbescheinigung is some kind of a family check. It must not be stamped at the nearest Bürgeramt. The certification procedure is quick, not to mention waiting for an appointment, 5 minutes at a time. Update: I have registered Kindergelt in Familienkasse Berlin Nord (Storkower Str. 120, 10407 Berlin), no Haushaltsbescheinigung certificate was required. Copy of the birth certificate Copy of the parent’s passport and each child’s passport. Copies of residence permits for parents and children. As of 2016, a tax number for the child (Steueridentifikationsnummer) is also required, which is received automatically upon receipt of the birth certificate. If you do not, you can order a new one via the [online form] (https://www.bzst.de/DE/Steuern_National/Steueridentifikationsnummer/ID_Eingabeformular/ID_Node.html). Update: I registered my Kindergeld with Familienkasse Berlin Nord (Storkower Str. 120, 10407 Berlin) on July 5, 2018, and did not need copies of my passports and permits, only took a copy of my Blau Karte. They said that the Haushaltsbescheinigung certificate from Bürgeramt was only needed if the child was born outside Germany. If the child was born in Germany, the Ombudsman will issue a special birth certificate for Kindergeld, which must be submitted in the original. If you wish to change your address or apply for a new visa/Aufenthaltserlaubnis, please contact Familienkasse! For example, if there was a Bluecard and then you got a Niderlassungserlaubnis, and reported to Familienkasse about visa/address changes, Kindergelt payments. will end when the Bluecard expires. Since Ausländerbehörde does not report changes to Familienkasse. All forms are available at http://www.kindergeld.org/formulare.html After you have collected the necessary documents, go to your local cash desk and submit all the documents.

The point is that instead of paying out the benefit, your tax base is reduced. In practice, this only makes sense if your total family income exceeds 64,000 euros per year. Here is an example of how to calculate http://www.kindergeld.info/kinderfreibetrag.html Elterngeld It’s a parental allowance for a parent who takes care of a child. Even a person who has never worked in Germany can get the minimum allowance. The conditions are as follows: The parent lives with the child the parent is lawfully in Germany the parent personally takes care of the child the parent does not work more than 30 hours a week until he or she receives Elterngeld The Elterngeld sum depends on the salary before the birth of the child, the total family income and ranges from 300 to 1800 Eur.

I did not find any information on how to do it correctly with a detailed step-by-step algorithm. You can also not count on the help of the secretaries of the consulate. It is better to take care of the powers of attorney in Ukraine It’s much cheaper. Usually the ratio is about 3-5 times depending on the type of power of attorney. In Ukraine, UAH 350-500, in the Consulate - 60-120 euros. Prices of the Consulate in Germany can be found here] (http://germany.mfa.gov.ua/ua/consular-affairs/consular-charges) If you are a couple, you should make a power of attorney for each other, so that anybody who comes to Ukraine could solve the issues for himself and for a partner. Otherwise, there will be no possibility to delegate and distribute efforts. The trip of one of the partners is not always possible, the banal saving of time and money can not be mentioned. If you have a trusted person in Ukraine, you should leave a power of attorney to him. Mother, father, brother, sister, even a good friend can be very helpful and help to avoid trouble. Let me remind you that a power of attorney is not only a general one. A notary in Ukraine will prepare a document for you according to your requirements and wishes, it is included in the price. You bring a ready-made document to the consulate, which they only certify. Detailed consultations, examples, not to mention the finished text of the power of attorney at the consulate, you will not receive. A notary in Ukraine will immediately register your power of attorney in the electronic registry, which guarantees its applicability. With the consulate there is a nuance about which a little later. In Ukraine, you will receive a power of attorney on the usual form. There are no forms in the consulate, you will be given an ordinary white sheet of paper with the seal of the consulate and the signature of the secretary who issued it to you. Many organizations and government agencies in Ukraine are already only this leads to stupor. Any power of attorney issued by the consulate must be registered upon arrival in Ukraine. Power of Attorney at the Consulate in Germany You are looking for or preparing the text of a power of attorney. No one can help you with this. Ideally, you will find a notary in Ukraine who will remotely agree to help. Or ask a friend or family member to come to the notary and put together the document you need. You take care of the correct dates, surnames, places and other things. The consul will take a receipt from you saying that you have no complaints about their work. It is not possible to pay the consular fee on site. You will be given the details to pay either at the bank, which is not easy and expensive in Germany, or from your account, but then you need to print the payment and bring it to the consulate. No one will tell you what you can pay from the account. Many people rush in search of a bank and pay 15-20 euros for the payment just by habit. It is better to clarify the amount of payment in advance at the consulate, and a personal visit. They answer by mail, but usually very evasively and not faster than 2-3 days later. In our experience, the notary secretary was not very busy and there was no long queue to him. the text of the power of attorney should be brought on a flash drive. Then they will quickly arrange it with their title and ending, print it out, let you read it and if all is well, you will sign it. After that they will sign it themselves and stamp it. Read carefully, in my case the consul made a mistake in the dates. If you find this out after everything is done, you will have to pay for the new power of attorney. IMPORTANT: Along with the power of attorney, you will also be given a document, let’s call it an Act, which is essentially a description of your power of attorney and contains a lot of useful information about where, how and by whom it was given out. It must be saved! I was not told about it and this document can be easily perceived as unnecessary. A power of attorney stamped and signed by the consulate secretary does not work until it is registered in the unified electronic state power of attorney register. In private relationships and some public bodies, this may not be an obstacle. But for example, in a bank, your power of attorney will be checked for registration and if it is not, for them it is an empty piece of paper, though with a beautiful seal and the signature of the secretary of the consulate. To register a power of attorney you need a visit to the Ukrainian Notary, who will do it for you only in the presence of the same Act. I wrote in paragraph 6. Without it, he will most likely also not be able to help you and your power of attorney will have no legal effect. My actions in Ukraine I took a power of attorney with me to Ukraine I registered it with the notary, look for the right one. Successfully used his wife’s individual entrepreneur (FLP) to close down, as well as several bank accounts, and they are checking very carefully. Already in Ukraine I have issued a power of attorney for my mother not to repeat mistakes and publicity with the consulate. It is also much cheaper.

    "content": "Internet The Internet in Germany is very poorly developed compared to Eastern Europe. The main providers are this: Vodafone Telekom O2 CableSurf 1&amp;1 As a rule, you will have to connect the Internet yourself after you move into the apartment. Prepare yourself for the long process, can take quite a while (up to 1-2 months) and is nervous. At [Check24.de] (https://www.check24.de/) you can [compare] (https://www.check24.de/dsl-handy/input/) the tariffs between and their prices. There you can also see the availability of the tariff in your particular home (brutal traffic lights) or on the site of a particular provider. It is strongly recommended that you check the availability of the tariff at both [Check24.de] (https://www.check24.de/) and the provider’s website once again for your specific address, as the information may vary. Sometimes the provider’s website may contain irrelevant information about your home, and even the technical support will assure you that everything will be typed-top, but in fact, it may turn out that this tariff will not be available to you. You may be offered a lower rate or you may be asked to cancel an existing contract unilaterally. Connections Depending on where you are staying, you may be able to choose from a variety of connectivity options, but you won’t find the best one here, because, as practice shows, DSL, that cable may or may not be miserable in every single case. DSL; VDSL; Kabel; HSDPA/LTE. Each of the above types of connection can be extremely bad in its own way, for example: DSL - may suddenly be slower than the one stated in the contract; VDSL - the same rake as above; Kabel - can “sag” in the evenings, it is necessary to treat with caution to such type of connection in the big inhabited complexes in the central areas; HSDPA/LTE - may not have sufficient coverage in your area/house or if you decide to live in a basement or bunker. Equipment Different ISPs offer different connectivity options, hence the different types of equipment that you need to get the Internet up and running. The options are quite different, such as a DSL router, (W)LAN router, DSL+LTE hybrid models, or fully LTE routers. Such equipment can be either paid or free of charge. When choosing a tariff, you need to watch carefully what you take “in load”. If you already have your own fashion router, it is likely to be more profitable for you to take the option of free equipment from your provider, because you will be able to connect your router to it yourself. Contract Once you have decided on the provider and type of connection, you need to carefully understand that the price of all “promotional” pages of providers is specified for the first year of use, and in almost all cases doubles in the second year. Almost all contracts are designed for 2 years without the possibility of _(in fact, it is possible, but with big reservations) _ to change providers. Even at the conclusion of the contract, to you can try to steal any paid nonsense, such as Security Package which is free of charge the first three months and then - for a fee. In most cases, you will need to make Kündigung (Withdrawal Request) in your provider’s personal office one month before the package becomes available for a fee. For example, in the case of Vodafone, you can cancel a security package (Sicherheitspaket) [here] (https://kabel.vodafone.de/kontakt/formular?formKey=EMailDiensteSicherheitspaketKuendigungKunde). You can also try to negotiate a mobile phone contract, of course, for 2 years, too, if you miss this point - then you won’t get away with it. Traffic restrictions Some ISPs don’t seem to have realized it’s 2017 yet. Under the terms of your tariffs (specify for yourself at the time of reading), there is a limit on the total amount of traffic that you have driven through the channel in one billing period. After reaching the limit, your speed is usually limited to 64 Kbps. Always read the full description of the product (tariff) on the site, read the smallest font. Don’t forget - Germany is a legal country. It works here and it will be a big problem for you if you don’t want to play here by these rules. Everything rests on laws, contracts, paperwork. Nobody will deal with you much. The agreement was signed - pay. Have you signed up for traffic restrictions? You will have to eat a cactus for the entire term of the contract, under which you have signed - and this is usually 2 years. Changing providers You can change providers by writing to Kündigung 3 months before the end of your contract, otherwise your current contract will be renewed for another year**. You will then contact your new provider with a request for connection and inform them of the date on which your previous contract was terminated. If you have the right to cancel your contract prematurely, you are considered a “new customer” for the new provider, not someone who changes providers. Contract prices for new customers are usually cheaper. As it turns out, if you have a DSL connected and need to connect to another DSL, it is not possible to have two simultaneous DSL connections from different providers. Which of course is frustrating because you will most likely have a time lag in this time interval. Khaki Here are described various known “khaki” that you can try to use to relieve all the pain of the German service and the Internet in particular. 1. The contract with Vodafone is concluded, and the technician will not know when (after 3 weeks) We’re not panicking.

This modem comes with a SIM card and looks like a small box, has a small size and works simply according to the principle: plug in the SIM card - connect to WiFi. 2. Low speed on Vodafone? Contact customer support via phone or [Facebook group] (https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/vodafoneDE) and ask for a discount or a couple of free months’ worth of Internet access. You are more likely to be offered a free High-speed package on your mobile phone if you have a Vodafone or if you are offered to activate a traffic package on an LTE modem (see hack #1) while they cause you problems on your DSL/Kabel. 3. My contract with Vodafone is coming to an end. There is an option to save money As a rule, from the second year onwards, the contract price increases. If you send to Vodafone a notice of termination of the contract, the phone number 0800 - 664 76 08 “call and stay” will appear in your personal cabinet If you call and say that you decided to stay - you can get bonus conditions as for new customers (free connection and WiFi router) + 3 months free of charge. Don’t forget that a new contract for 2 years will begin! 4. Are you going to connect to Telekom? Take your time! Go to their official website, there is an online chat room. Tell me that you are a new client and are now thinking between Telekom and X provider. Ask for a discount or free Internet for the first couple of months in exchange for the fact that you will give preference to Telekom. **5. have you just graduated from university or are you still relatively young? Great news! Some ISPs have noticed Telekom, Vodafone and 1&amp;1 have tariffs for “youth”. As a rule, they are available for clients, under 27-28 years old. Such tariffs are cheaper than the rest. 6. I need to send the router back to the provider. Do I have to pay? WTF? Call the call centre and insist that a courier be sent to you. Returning what you received for free and paying for it is bullshit from any point of view. In general, the service rule in Germany is simple - ask and agree. Until you try to impose your terms and conditions on the company (within adequate limits) - you will be provided with a service under the contract, or worse (as practice shows). Termination of the contract Legal Disclaimer: The paragraph below does not provide legal advice of any kind, and we cannot guarantee that the information is accurate, complete or up-to-date. The opinions and thoughts posted on this page are of a casual nature and may change after further reflection.

Full version in Russian. There are two types of contract cancellation in Germany: 1) Die reguläre (ordentliche) Kündigung - 3 months’ standard notice; 2) Die vorzeitige (außerordentliche) Kündigung - early termination due to extraordinary circumstances. The second option will be considered here, and some features will need to be referred to in order to terminate the contract with your provider under these conditions. Here is an indicative list of situations where you are entitled to request an early termination of the contract: If the connection is technically impossible in your apartment; If you change from DSL to Kabel and you have your DSL cut off, but Kabel is not connected for months; If the connection speed is very low; If the line is physically damaged; If you are moving within Germany or from Germany; If the technician does not come to the appointed appointment; If the equipment (modem) is defective; If you politely ask and you will be lowered. It is suggested that you look for the exact list yourself or contact a lawyer who will charge you as much money as your entire annual Internet contract will cost. An indicative list of laws to rely on if you decide to press your ISP with this topic in case you have a slow Internet speed: § 626 https://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/626.html § 314 https://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/314.html There is also [Munich court decision 223 C 20760/14 of 07.11.2014] (http://www.damm-legal.de/ag-muenchen-viel-zu-langsames-dsl-ist-ausserordentlicher-kuendigungsgrund), which states that a person was able to terminate the contract prematurely, having an official speed of 18 Mbit/sec, although in fact the speed did not exceed 6 Mbit/sec. It is recommended to read it, compare your situation and the situation described there. This should help in writing the letter to the provider. As a rule, in order for your complaints to be substantiated, it is necessary to collect data on connection speed on different days, at least 3 consecutive days. It is recommended to find out Which speed check your particular ISP recommends, they all have different speeds and are usually branded and integrated with their ticket system. You should not wave your fists if the speed, for example, is 45 Mbit/sec, and the contract states 50 Mbit/sec. As it is so-called “up to …”. In the same way the contract must have a baseline velocity bar declared. At Vodafone, for example, on DSL 50 tariff it is 27.9 Mbit/sec for downloading and 2.7 Mbit/sec for aload. If the speed is stably lower than these parameters - think for yourself. Chances to “jump off” are very high. In the letter to the provider, it is necessary to specify terms in which it should eliminate malfunctions in your opinion, Otherwise, by the date you specified in the letter, you must have your contract terminated. Here, for example, is a site where you can read a little more information on this topic. If the provider makes a brick face, starts to ignore you and so on, you have several options for this case: 1) Go to [Bundesnetzagentur] (https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de) is like the German Communications Agency, where you can start complaining about the provider without going to trial. There should be an online complaint form; 2) Seek legal advice (suddenly). Disclaimer in Russian again:** If you are not sure that you will do the right thing after reading the above, ask for qualified assistance from lawyers.",

    "content": "The apartment question Apartments in Germany are searched for only in person, with a visit and inspections. It is not possible to find a good option for a long time remotely. Therefore, the sequence usually looks like this: You haven’t arrived yet, but you are looking for a place to stay for the first time. For the most part, there are only two options - Airbnb/https://www.mrlodge.com/ or an agency (see list below). You can try to write to the hosts on the ads, but the chance to get a contract disappears. Attention: Find out in advance so that you can register (Anmeldung). Otherwise, it may be difficult to get insurance, SCHUFA or open a bank account. You have already arrived, you have gone to work, but you are on probation (or on a temporary contract, which is even worse), you have not yet received your wages, perhaps you do not speak German. At this stage, your task is to get at least some kind of rental contract for more or less long term (at least six months or a year). Due to the input data “just arrived”, it will be quite difficult, because competition among tenants is high, the apartment can be claimed by dozens, if not hundreds of people (in Berlin easier, in Munich more difficult). But practice shows that in 3-4 weeks there are usually options. Prepare to check new ads several times a day in the first month, print out packs of documents and spend the evenings on numerous inspections of apartments. Don’t despair, sooner or later, and there will be a holiday on your street. You are already “experienced”, with a stable salary in recent months, there is an awareness of what’s going on around you. You can look for a “dream apartment” rather than a “what you get”. The process is no different from the previous stage except that now you look much more reliable for the landlords, so the offers should be noticeably more and the search time will be less. Step-by-step instructions This section will focus on the second point of the search, as it is the most interesting. So, how to search for an apartment? Choose any site from the list below, register there, fill out a profile if possible. To begin with, we recommend https://www.immobilienscout24.de/ aka “Scout” as the largest one. 2) Determine your search area(s). The closer you get to the center, the more expensive and difficult it is to take off. The most budget options are outside the city limits. Therefore, it is useful to study the transport scheme of the selected area, which modes of transport are there - S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Bus, Tram - and with what frequency. Plot a route in Google Maps from home to work and estimate the travel time, number of stops, distance from home / work, etc. on the selected sites you can view the appearance of new apartments in the area of search. In the case of Scout, it is better to use the mobile application - it is in English and has wide functionality. It is recommended to create “Saved search”, and then you will receive push notifications about new ads at the moment of their publication. The sooner you respond to an ad, the more likely it is that you will be called to view it. You can also set up notifications for email, FB Messenger or notifications in your browser. Keep in mind that demand is very high and the speed of response is important. Prepare an “opening speech” - a message that will be sent to hosts when responding to the ad. It is recommended to write in either German or German and English. Invite colleagues or acquaintances to evaluate your work if you are not sure if you know the language. The most important thing! Prepare a set of documents. This is exactly what will distinguish you among many other applicants for an apartment, it is possible with the best input data. When you give владельцу агенту a pre-prepared folder with all your documents, instead of filling out the questionnaire on your lap in the dark with a pen that does not write - this is a very good plus in your favor. And since you probably don’t have any other advantages at the moment, you should use the opportunity to the maximum. It is also recommended to put electronic copies of documents, for example, on Google Drive or Dropbox, and send a link to them immediately when responding to the ad. As a matter of fact, everything is on your side. Now it remains to constantly check the service for new ads and respond to anything that looks as decent and fits into your budget. If you are invited to the inspection - immediately agree and go. If you like everything in the apartment, then give the owner or agent your set of documents and hope for the best. One day they will call you and say, “We are ready to rent you an apartment. You are happy, but not too much, because the contract has not yet been signed. You agree with your landlord on the contract, read it yourself or let your German-speaking colleagues read it, sign it - and that’s where your torment ends. You can turn off the notifications, and, finally, in the morning your first thing will be not to view new ads and response, but shower and breakfast :). Waiting for the date of entry. When accepting the apartment, look carefully at the condition, check plumbing, switches, electrical appliances, inspect the corners for mold. Record all malfunctions/faults/remarks, otherwise they will be written on you at the end of your contract. Do not forget about the conditions of return of the apartment (should be described in the contract): often the apartment is rented to you without furniture and freshly renovated, you will most likely have to whitewash all the walls and bring the flooring to its original condition (lacquer паркет переложить laminate). Get the keys to the apartment, garage, basement (optional) and start to enjoy life. Dictionary of the apartment question: Wohnung is actually a “home”. Zimmer is a room, usually found in the context of “2 Zi Wohnung”. Kalt - “cold”, “basic” cost of rent, excluding utilities and other services. Nebenkosten - additional payments, usually including water, heating, etc. Attention - [electricity] (./electricity.md) is almost never included in Nebenkosten, it will have to be paid separately, as well as for the Internet. Warm is a “warm” price, usually Kalt + Nebenkosten, perhaps plus additional charges, for example, for a garage. In general, this is the amount that you will have to pay your landlord every month. Mieter is you, so you are the tenant. Vermieter is a landlord, the landlord who rents the property, the landlord. The Besichtigungs Termin is a personal meeting to examine the apartment. Mietvertrag - rental contract. WG (Wohngemeinschaft) - shared accommodation. When searching for a room, we are guided by this abbreviation. Documents As described above, it is recommended to prepare a folder with all documents in advance. Namely: Questionnaire, so-called Mieterselbstauskunft. In the Internet there is a set of variants, one of the most simple and accessible here [this] (http://www.mietrecht-hilfe.de/media/downloads/Selbstauskunft-Mieter-Vorlage.pdf). The questionnaire for two persons if you are going to remove one, it is possible in the second column to put dashes. Fill in all truthfully, including your salary. The last three pay slips (payslips), if you have one, or at the end of a salary contract. Of course, you don’t need to make a copy of the multipage contract, but be prepared to show it to the owner. SCHUFA. Something like your credit history, as well as some sort of evaluation of you as a payer. Even if you have just arrived, it is recommended to get it. Often, a beautiful sheet of “Zertifikat” is enough for the landlords to see that only positive entries have been found in your history, but particularly inquisitive landlords can also ask for a sheet that shows your score (SCHUFA-Basisscore). See details below. A letter of recommendation from work. Ask the company or your manager to write you something official on the company logo and seal form. The basic minimum is “confirm that such a person is working for our company from such a date on an open-ended contract”. A letter of recommendation from the current (previous) owner. Most likely, even at a temporary apartment you will have an apartment owner or an agency - ask them to write you a letter about how good you are, pay your rent in time and do not make fires in the room. The document is called Mietschuldenfreiheitsbestätigung or [Mietzahlungsbestätigung] (https://www.immobilienscout24.de/ratgeber/wohnungsbewerbung/mietzahlungsbestaetigung.html). How to [request] (https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/4qwt9f/q_how_to_request/). Copy of passport. It is believed that it is better to put your signature on the copy. The first three items belong to the must have category (Schufa, theoretically, can be shown later, but it is better to have all the documents in hand). The rest is optional, but highly recommended. SCHUFA SCHUFA is a large German organization which, among other things, deals with credit histories and assessment of “reliability” of German residents. If you all pay on time, do not receive any fines and have a salary, there should normally be no problem. But late payments, frequent changes of the bank, malicious violations of laws (repeated travel without a ticket, for example), a large number of loans - all this can negatively affect your assessment, so it will be more difficult for you to find an apartment (which owner wants to rent out a malicious non-payer), the banks will refuse the loan or give out at a robbery rate, and so on. Usually, SCHUFA is a credit history statement that includes a certificate of your reliability and a sheet of accurate SCHUFA-Basisscore (percentage from 0 to 100). The higher the score, the better. 95% and above is considered a good grade, 98% and above is ideal. The paperwork is valid for three to four months, which should be enough to find an apartment even in the most difficult cases. How to get it: If you need to find an apartment urgently, ask Postbank or Volksbank ([see branch map] (https://www.meineschufa.de/index.php?site=14_3)). You must have your registration (address in Germany), passport and a German bank account with you**. They do it in 10 minutes. The cost is 29.95 euros. Money will be deducted from the account within 1-2 weeks. According to § 34 of the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz SCHUFA, you can get it free of charge once a year by filling out a paper form and sending it by post. Follow this very clear [instructions] (http://www.ratgeber-geld.de/schufa/auskunft.html). The form can be found [here] (https://www.meineschufa.de/index.php?site=11_3_1). You can also get SCHUFA through a “scout” - [service link] (https://bonitaetscheck.immobilienscout24.de/). It costs 29.95 euros. Sent either to a mailbox or to download an electronic version. The bonus is a monthly trial period of the premium account (as of the beginning of 2018). If you don’t need a premium account (and you probably don’t need it), it’s better to turn it off at once, because otherwise it will automatically last and Scout will quietly start to write off the subscription fee every month.

Apartments can also be rented from companies, such as Wohnungsgenossenschaften, in addition to “private individuals”. The advantage is that the company has no disadvantages of “private parties”, e.g. self-necessity, improper conduct of the landlord (strange requirements and prohibitions), legal aspects (e.g. less often cheating with Nebenkostenabrechnung). Wohnungsgenossenschaften usually rent a house without a broker, i.e. you can save money on brokerage. Disadvantages: The waiting time for an apartment can be quite a long time for a Wohnungsgenossenschaften in Berlin, depending on the company and district (http://www.berlin.de/special/immobilien-und-wohnen/adressen/wohnungsbaugenossenschaft/).

The Blue Card comrades have a limited residence permit, which is why temporary consular registration is required. To get registered, you need to come to the embassy during the reception hours and sign up for the consular registration window (previously there was a window number 1) Documents: application; (issued on the spot at the guard’s office) I will fill in the oblast card of the Ukrainian community, which is being sold behind the cordon for hours; (issued on the spot at the guard’s office) a passport document or a ditini document; copies of the passport document or the Dietini proiznon document with the writings and documents about the document’s author; the original and a copy of the permit issued by the competent authorities of the foreign state, which gives the right to reside in the foreign state; photocard with 35x45 mm size; certificate of registration of the place of residence behind the cord (Meldebescheinigung), seen no more than 6 months before the submission of documents for the Timeconsular consular region.

Passport () Any citizen of the Russian Federation has the right to obtain a second passport “in addition to the existing one”, you can come to the consulate and ask for it. The procedure is quite simple - go to the website of the Consulate General ([in Munich] (https://rusconsmchn.mid.ru)), optionally read all the details, then go to the site to fill in the application for the issuance of a passport https://zp.midpass.ru/, where we fill in all the standard fields (first name, last name, what and where you did the last 10 years, about the army like there were also some questions, and everything like that), and then print on paper an electronic application and make an appointment. In principle, the terms are quite accessible and can usually be booked for the next week. At the appointed time, come and stand in a live queue “and all here by appointment”. As everywhere write - no bags and backpacks (strictly), with only a minimum of things (phone, keys, flashlight, remote control from the garage - you can), but at the entrance everything must be laid out of pockets and go through the frame. Phone is strictly disconnected - check that it is switched off. On the territory of the consulate itself, an electronic queue machine, poke into a button, get a ticket and wait for your number on the scoreboard. Photographed on the spot, the signature is taken on the tablet electronically. It makes sense to repeat “the second passport several times, in addition to the existing one”, and even though there was a clear choice when filling out the application, it is not always obvious to the consul - I was asked “why do you want to change your passport, but you have less than 5 years to him? - But after the answer “no, no, no, don’t change, the second passport” everything is in its place. In exchange for the documents, you get a leaflet with a number that you can use to track progress on the site. Getting a ready passport without a term, Monthly from 10:00 to 12:30 in order of live queue. Official term - not less than 2, but max. 3 months. My experience is much more optimistic: The end of September - I filled in an electronic application, but I was going on vacation, I was too lazy to go. November 17 - came to the consulate and submitted documents December 18th - “passport ready” notification has arrived by email December 19 - came in and took The date of issue of the newest passport is “November 27”, i.e. it was actually made within 10 days. What to pay attention to (Consulate General in Munich, November-December 2017) When filling in the electronic application form, the transliteration of your first name will be done automatically and, accordingly, will most likely not coincide with the transliteration in your current passport. If you changed your passport, if you wanted to keep the old transliteration you would have to write a simple application in a free form “please keep it in your old passport as well”. In case of the second passport - there is no choice, transliteration will be the same as in the main passport, even if the electronic application was not so and you do not attach any additional applications. According to the consul, “for second passports, the spelling is always the same as in the first one. Things at the consulate - no bags, just a phone, passports and paper. Leave nowhere, only on the street or at passers-by. Payment for the passport is accepted strictly only by EU card. Do not accept cash, do not accept normal cards. I had to look for a person in line with the EU card and ask him to pay for me and give him the money in cash. It is more profitable to make the second foreign passport before moving to the Russian Federation, it is 2500 rubles (like there was a discount, if you make it through public services), here - *777 euros * Myth - the second foreign passport is given for the period of validity of the first - this is not true for a long time. New passport * for new 10 years from the date of manufacture *.",

    "content": "Review Operators with their own networks are [Vodafone] (https://www.vodafone.de/), [O2] (https://www.o2online.de/), [T-Mobile] (https://www.t-mobile.de/), [E-Plus] (https://www.handyflatrate.de/) (the latter was purchased by O2). Contracts from real operators are expensive, you can take the phone in installments. There are a large number of virtual operators, many of which (already) belong to Drillish AG. Usually, virtual operators offer lower tariffs, both prepaid and contractual. For comparison of operators it is convenient to use the service [check24] (https://check24.de) - it shows not only the size of packets (traffic, minutes) and their cost, but also what real operator uses this virtual one, what happens when the traffic limit is exceeded - usually small additional packets are automatically sold at an inflated price, whether it is possible to disable these additional packets and stay at a limited speed, etc. The same speed can be reduced to different values, for example, O2 now (in summer 2017) is cut to megabit per second, not 16 kilobits, as in most other operators. Tariffs change regularly, the information in this file below is most likely not relevant at the moment when you read these lines. For example: ALDI Talk is a convenient prepaid option for the Internet, 10 euros per 2.5 GB (Internet Flatrate L) or 15 euros per 5.5 GB (Internet Flatrate XL) per month throughout Germany. The SIM card costs 13 Euros, 10 Euros in an account. It is important that you activate your SIM card after purchasing it. You can do this at the bank or at the post office if you speak German. You can show your passport online via video call. Shop staff can do little to help you, you need to find the internet to activate it yourself. Actual as of February 2019. User testimonial: `O2, LTE was launched in 2018. Refill via coupons at the cash desk or you can make SEPA and immediately drop the money. The tariff works for a month (if you activate it on February 2, it will be switched off on March 2) and then the “standard”, not very advantageous tariff will be activated. Also from the pleasant: when the traffic is over - will be unlimited on 56KB / s, and not in the minus. PremiumSIM is an interesting variant with a contract (not prepaid), but you can break it up in a month. 10 euros for 2-3 GB of Internet in Germany + 1 GB in EU, unlimited calls and SMS. Actual for July 2017 DeutschlandSIM - tariffs for Vodafone, O2 networks, you can select the number. CallYa from Vodafone. Prepaid, you can set up automatic debiting of the bank account.

[Full list of mobile operators in Germany (German)] (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Mobilfunkdiscounter_in_Deutschland) Transferring the number between operators When changing operator, you can save the phone number. The process is not fast, formal, but it works with little or no misfire. Typical changeover sequence from Provider A to Provider B (e.g. from ALDI Talk to PremiumSIM): Refill the account of Provider A so that the account has the necessary amount of money to open the number. Yes, this service is usually chargeable and costs about 25 euros. A little sweetens the pill, which is usually ~20 Euros for operator B if the number has been transferred, which means that the total cost is not as high. Write to Provider A that you wish to “unbind” the number. You need to fill in and sign the form, and then send it to the provider either by email or paper mail. In the case of ALDI Talk, all you have to do is send the scan to your e-mail address. The form (Einwilligung zur Rufnummernübernahme) can be found here (https://www.alditalk.de/downloads-formulare) or obtained directly from an employee after contacting the contact center. Waiting for confirmation that the number is open and available to the new operator. Usually it takes a few working days from the call to the confirmation, quite quickly. The number will be available for “capture” within 3 months. Notify Provider B that you want to move the number. Often this can be done immediately at the time of registration with Provider B, or send a separate request. In case of PremiumSIM request you can send it through your personal cabinet, there you can see the status of the request. Waiting for confirmation from Provider B. A little less than a week, they will send you an SMS with the date when the final transfer will be made After that date, everything should work, you’re happy. The whole process from the submission of the application to operator A to the completion of the migration takes about 2 weeks. Buying a card You can buy in supermarkets without documents, at the operator’s office (sometimes enough passports, sometimes - ask for confirmation of permanent residence, ie registration), and order online because most virtual operators do not have any physical presence. In this case, it takes about a week to order-deliver-activate, etc. This, too, should be taken into account, and for the first time you can take an inexpensive prepaid rate in the nearest supermarket. Don’t forget to ask for the right size card right away, so that you don’t have to go to менять вырезать Mobile Internet is fast, convenient, and also ends quickly. Activation of the card Starting in July 2017, activation is possible only on a permanent document containing passport data and address. The document is either scanned at the company’s office when purchased (if purchased at the operator’s office) or via videoconference on the website when activated. As of July 2017, Vodafone at the office offered to buy a tariff just for a Russian passport, O2 was denied sale to a non-resident (registration is required at least). In July 2017, LIDL showed only a passport from different sides for activation on a video call; registration was not required, i.e. the address was not checked at all. Activation of a LIDL card under a Ukrainian passport is impossible. February 2019 - Aldi activation via video call, you need to show your passport (Reisepass option). Theoretically, you can even choose the Russian language for the call, but the result is English. To make a call you need a stable internet connection. Types of tariffs Almost all operators offer: XX minutes, Uu SMS and VV Megabyte, and usually very few megabytes. There are virtual operators. You can buy packets from them without calls / SMS, only data transfer. The card is sent after registration by mail or bought in a Turkish shop (without any documents).

They are available: Buying a recharge voucher in a store or in the subway (the recharge code is printed on the receipt). For replenishment it is usually necessary to dial a combination *100*code_replenishment# and the call button on the phone. You can also enter the code through a mobile application (e.g. ALDI Talk) online replenishment via cards.

    "content": "Taxes Every German has a tax identification number and tax class. Identification number The identification number (Identifikationsnummer) is issued automatically after the first [place of residence registration] (registration%20 place of residence%20%20 place of residence.md) in Germany. The numbering document is sent by post to the specified address of residence a few days after registration. If more than a week has passed and the letter has not arrived, or if the number is needed sooner (for the employer), you can go to Finanzamt (see below) and get the document in hand. It is believed that this can be done a couple of working days after the registration of the place of residence, so that the number can be generated and assigned. Unfortunately, this is not always possible: In March 2018, Finanzamt Neukölln refused to inform Identifikationsnummer even 2 weeks after registration, citing the need to obtain it by mail. Alternatively, you can get a free letter with your identification number by sending [online application] (https://www.bzst.de/DE/Steuern_National/Steuerliche_Identifikationsnummer/ID_Eingabeformular/ID_Node.html). The identification number must be given to the employer and to [bank] (20%20 and%20Banking.md Finance) (an account can be opened without a tax number, but then it must be submitted later) and [insurance company] (Insurance.md) (optional). In general, this number is needed very rarely, there is no need to remember or carry it with you. Tax class The tax class (Steuerklasse) determines the amount of taxes levied on income. The class mainly depends on marital status. For tax purposes, marriage (life partnership) is only taken into account when the spouses (partners) reside together in Germany, i.e. are registered in the same home. For example, if a husband comes to Germany before his wife, he will be in the single-entry class before her arrival and registration. A single, childless person is in the 1st grade. A single person with a child(ren) is in 2nd grade. Spouses (partners) or both have the 4th grade; or one spouse has the 3rd grade, and the second - necessarily the 5th grade. Spouses have the right to choose which of these two combinations they want to belong to. The difference is that classes 4+4 are usually advantageous when both spouses work and receive approximately the same income. Classes 3+5 are usually advantageous when only one of the spouses works or the income of the other spouse is much lower. In this case, a working (earning much more) spouse takes the 3rd grade and a non-working (earning much less) spouse takes the 5th grade. The tax rates in the 3rd grade are lower than in the 4th grade and higher in the 5th grade than in the 4th grade. **Note: **If the spouses have to file a 3+5 tax return together, otherwise they will be recalculated in the 4th grade and one will be charged (5th), and the other will be deducted (3rd). The 6th grade is assigned to people who have more than one job at a time. This is the class that levies the most taxes. The tax authority automatically assigns a tax class after registration of the place of residence. As a rule, by default, if the spouses are registered together and at the same time, they will both be assigned the 4th class, and in other cases the 1st class will be assigned. However, it may happen that they will be assigned 1st or even 6th grade! Therefore, it is always better to reinsure yourself and go to find out, and if necessary - to change your tax class. To choose a combination of 3+5 classes, you need to apply. It is best to do this immediately after receiving the tax number, without delay, otherwise there is a possibility that some time (and even before the end of the year) taxes will be charged on the old class. However, after the end of the year and the submission of the declaration (see below), it will be possible to recalculate and refund overpaid taxes. To change classes you need to come to Finanzamt (see below) and submit the corresponding [application] (https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/printout/034003.pdf) (you can take the form from Finanzamt). Spouses should come together because the application is submitted jointly. Finanzamt employees can allow one spouse to apply for both, but they can also refuse to do so. Everyone must bring their passport, residence registration document and tax number with them. Once you have submitted your application, you will immediately receive a tax class assignment document. How to fill in the form: Section A is divided into 2 parts, for two spouses respectively, you need to fill in all the lines of the section. In Section B we mark only line 17, in which you want to mark the current tax classes of the spouses (if you have not changed it before it is 4/4), and line 18 in which you specify the desired. In line 43 Sections C you need to put the date and signatures of the two spouses. March 2018. Finanzamt Neukölln has not issued any change of tax class documents, offering to wait for the post office. May 2018. Finanzamt Mitte also did not issue the document and said they would send it to the employer. September 2018. Finanzamt Mitte. Except for the application, no documents were requested. Accepted without a wife’s tax number (left the field blank) and entered my current class. I applied myself without my wife. Borrowed all 2 minutes. They said that the new class is already available in the program from accountants, no paperwork was given. Immediately after receiving the new tax class you need to notify the employer**. Moreover, it happens that the employer withholds taxes from the employee at the maximum, 6th grade until the employee confirms the appointment of another class - so it is better to get a document confirming your class from Finanzamt as soon as possible and give a copy of it to the employer. Finanzamt Unlike residence registration, Finanzamt will only serve you at your place of residence. You can find out which Finanzamt you belong to on the [official website] (http://gemfa.bzst.bund.de/gemfai.exe). The easiest way to do this is to enter your postcode (choose Postleitzahl from the Art des Suchbegriffs list). “TV tax” See the corresponding [page] (Television.md) Tax Calculator [Wage calculator] (http://www.brutto-netto-rechner.info/gehalt/gross_net_calculator_germany.php) netto/brutto (for standard TK health insurance, 0.8% is used, for tax class information, see below) [Chat bot] (https://m.me/GermanWageTaxCalc) for calculating the monthly netto salary with the function of remembering the previous calculation. Tax return and tax refund After the end of each calendar year, a tax return must be submitted. This may be mandatory (e.g. for classes 3+5 if both spouses worked in the reporting year). However, even if you do not have to file a declaration, it makes sense. Taxes are recalculated on the basis of the declaration and, in many cases, substantial amounts are refunded (tax refund, tax deduction). The opposite situation is also possible when you are asked to pay more. A declaration can be made and filed in several ways: Contact a consultant at Lohnsteuerhilfeverein (association for help with tax returns), who will prepare and submit a tax return for you and communicate with the tax authorities. The services of a consultant can cost from one to several hundred Euros depending on your income. It is also important to remember that the first time you file a tax return with such a consultant, you usually apply for membership in the association to which the consultant belongs. If you plan to file your own declaration the following year, you should explicitly withdraw from the association. And you usually need to do this before the next tax year begins. Examples of Lohnsteuerhilfeverein: https://www.vlh.de/ Sync by honeybunny http://lab-berlin.de/ Contact a Steuerberater if you are unable to use Lohnsteuerhilfeverein for any reason. The reason may be that you or your spouse is not an employee but a freelancer or an entrepreneur (Lohnsteuerhilfeverein simply does not have the right to tax the self-employed), or you just have some complicated case of taxes (different sources of income or high costs that you want to write off from the taxable base). Steuerberater’s services are much more expensive than Lohnsteuerhilfeverein’s consultants (conditionally from 500 Euros for filing a tax return, depending on the income and complexity of the case). In general, employees should be able to apply for a Lohnsteuerhilfeverein even in the first year after moving. To fill in the declaration** by yourself** with one of the paid programs. The cost of the license is usually a few tens of euros.

It is recommended to get acquainted at least once to understand the basic principles of taxation in Germany. Excellent [series of articles] (http://expat-rusde.livejournal.com/52948.html) in Russian on self-filling in the declaration (2014). The detailed description of what to fill in and how to do it. It is recommended that you apply to Lohnsteuerhilfeverein for the first year of your life in Germany or use the services of a tax advisor. In the first year, you can get a large refund. A few comments on this subject: A large refund is due to the fact that the annual income tax depends on the amount received in that year. Your company pays income tax based on your salary for 12 months. Thus, if you received the money in less than 12 months, as you arrived in, say, October, it means that the company has listed too much tax and you are entitled to a refund. Keywords for your search: Steuerfreibetrag, Progressionsvorbehalt. The amount of income for the year is the main factor for calculating income tax. Therefore, if you work, for example, from January 1 to December 31 (the whole year in full), it is likely that you will not get a large refund. If you come alone and your wife, disabled children, parents with low incomes, whom you have supported financially, are temporarily left behind, it can also be beneficial for you in a tax sense. Information](https://github.com/ru-de/faq/raw/master/files/parentstaxreturn.doc) about tax refunds for parental assistance. Moving expenses (Umzugskosten) can have an impact on your taxes. If you are moving within Germany, you need to make the move conditional on your employment (e.g. the time spent travelling to work is significantly reduced). The tax office may require an income report before moving to Germany, so it is advisable to have an income report from the previous place of residence (2-NDFL in Russia). General recommendation: Keep all receipts and receipts for the entire time in Germany, sort by year. Especially from anything that might have something to do with your work. You need to submit your declaration by the end of May** (2019 to the end of July) of the following year, but if you are using a tax consultant, by the end of next year. If you have never filed a tax return, you have 7 years to do so. The procedure for filing previous years’ declarations does not matter. Refunds of taxes for helping close relatives The general idea is that you can reduce your tax base by helping your close relatives outside of Germany, whose income does not reach the minimum subsistence level in Germany.

Mom is a retired woman, she doesn’t work. This year I sent her a document that the tax authorities require to fill in and certify with the local state body (in our case, the passport office of the Russian Federation). She filled in the document, but she couldn’t get a stamp anywhere, and it’s clear that nobody wants to sign it and put a stamp on some strange form. Instead, we decided to take a certificate of family composition and a certificate of pension payments for the year, as well as made a translation of these two certificates in Russia with a notary certification. He filled in the tax return himself via Smartsteuer. After filling in the electronic form by letter, he additionally sent to the tax office a completed, but not certified document, which they require and these two certificates from Russia. The refunds were made, nothing was additionally requested. They returned about 20% of the transferred amount. Return of contributions to the pension fund after leaving Germany As you know, if you have lived in Germany for less than 5 years, you are not entitled to a pension from Germany. If you decide to leave the country and the EU (important! Here and below, the phrase “moving out of Germany” means moving out of the EU and probably UK EEA (todo: to clarify)), you have the right to receive your pension contributions back. For reference, this is 9.35% of your gross salary (as of 2017). Next is a free translation of the topic from [ToyTownGermany] (https://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/topic/371985-pension-refund-experience-after-moving-to-the-us/) Official website http://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/en/Navigation/englisch_index_node.html By “5 years” we mean “60 months of contributions”. Depending on the situation, contributions made in another EU country may also be taken into account here, so if your situation is similar to “59 months in Germany and 2 years in the UK”, it is better to check in advance and consult a lawyer. You should not be a citizen of the EU/EEA/CH The possibility to refund your contributions only appears after 2 years from the moment of moving from Germany. Two forms must be completed: V0901 (basic application for return) and [A1310] (http://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/Allgemein/de/Inhalt/5_Services/04_formulare_und_antraege/_pdf/A1310.html) (details for international payment if you do not have an account with a German bank) You should also visit [the German Embassy in your country] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8) to confirm your personal data and signature (?)

If it is not possible to leave one parent with the child, we first make a certificate for the child to return to the Republic of Belarus. We go to the Republic of Belarus and make a passport there. Then we make a visa for the child and go back to Germany. It’s almost impossible to get a Belarusian certificate in Berlin (June 2017) The embassy itself does not know which document they need (birth certificate) This unknown document cannot be apostilled All German authorities actually refuse to issue non-standard documents and certificates at the hospital, the only thing you can take is a Bescheid (hospital stay certificate) and a copy of Geburtsanzeige (an electronic printout of which the hospital sends to Amt), or any other apostille is unknown how and where, the original Geburtsanzeige will not be given to you, even a colored copy of which the embassy said “no”. Information from the embassy (http://germany.mfa.gov.by/ru/embassy/) - no information is available on the phone and no formal procedure exists, the only thing you are asked for is an “apostille certificate and translation from the German “About Birth”, to be sent to the Republic of Bashkortostan for further clarifications (it is recommended to call the Republic of Bashkortostan and ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). At the reception at the embassy, even if you have all the documents (Mutterpass, hospital statements, a copy of Geburtsanzeige, certificates of U1 and U2 examinations of the child, a contract for payment of hospital stay, etc.), the embassy refuses to recognize these documents and asks for the certificate “About Birth” without indicating its name in German. In the Geburtsurkunde department of the Standesamt, too, they have not heard anything about any “birth certificates” - they have all the documents in electronic form and they do not issue any “left” certificates as soon as the child is born automatically in the hospital’s database, and then the documents are sent to the Standesamt. An apostille can be made only in the embassy (€35) or in Belarus itself. Getting a passport in Belarus for a child born abroad, the main document to know about - Decree №200 of 26.04.2010. It is possible to go without the child, it is necessary to take with itself passports of both parents and translation of the apostille birth certificate (item 6 of article 15 of the Law of the Republic of Belarus from 28.10.2008 № 433-3), four photos 40х50мм (usual, not the person on all size as in the visa) printed on one sheet (it is desirable also scan on usb) The list of documents required to issue a passport is defined in Chapter 11 of Decree No. 200. Upon arrival, apply to the civil register office at the place of residence registration, stamp the birth of the child (necessary to cross the border of the Republic of Belarus, Decree No. 294 of 03.06.2008) Afterwards, go to the Settlement and Reference Center (RRC) at the place of residence registration and fill in two forms there: for registration (if both parents are registered together - it’s simple), and for obtaining a passport If the parents are registered in different places, you still need to have a notarized written consent of the other parent that he allows the child to be registered at such an address. After the certification of everything in the RCC, you will either be given a pack of papers - or they will send it to the Department of “Citizenship and Migration of Internal Affairs” (if it is necessary to wait a couple of days before applying for a passport) Come to the Department of Internal Affairs, submit all the documents - if you pay 20 euros for the acceleration of the minimum period of 7 calendar days from the date of submission When ready, come and get your passport - the only difference from the usual passport - on the second page will be written the place of birth (Germany …) YOU DO NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY CERTIFICATES OF RETURN FROM THE EMBASSY! All you need is a photo, 2 parents’ passports, translation of the apostille certificate. Bürgeramt: visa for a child If your Blaue Karte was issued by LABO, you can get a child visa from Bürgeramt. The service is called “Aufenthaltserlaubnis für im Bundesgebiet geborene Kinder Official source: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324269/en/ personal appearance (mom, dad, child) Parents’ passports Child’s passport Birth certificate of the child Photo 3*4.

    "content": "План действий для получивших job offer в Германии A few friends have already become happy owners of offers and now they are not tired to ask me about the plan of further action. I will collect in this post a brief summary of my answers, maybe it will be useful for you as well :) 1) [Getting a work visa at the embassy of your country] (Visa.md). To enter and start working in the country, you must obtain a national type D visa, which is also a work permit. 2) [Search for temporary apartment] (Apartment%20 in question md) Before you actually move, you need to find a temporary place of residence. Usually it is an apartment or room on Airbnb or similar services for about 1-2 months. You will need to register at this location (Anmeldung, owner’s consent - check in advance!) and be able to receive mail (very important in Germany!). 3) Completion of all business in the home country and actual relocation There’s no comment here, and I think it’s pretty clear. Although it would not be superfluous to check [duties in the homeland] (duties%20%20%20Rodina.md), as well as to issue [power of attorney] (Power of Attorney.md), because it will be more difficult and expensive abroad. 4) [Buying a SIM card and getting a local phone number] (Mobile%20 Connection.md) It is very convenient not to depend on free Wi-Fi networks and have the opportunity to consult with the world at any time. Also, a phone number is often needed to open a bank account. 5) [Registration at the place of residence] (Registration%20 place%20 place%20 place of residence.md). Sign up online in the local counterpart of the district administration - to register your address of residence. It is better to do this before coming to Germany, even if you do not know your address yet. In Berlin, pre-registration is for 2 months in advance, at [Berlin.de] (https://service.berlin.de/). The registration itself must be completed in person. During the first registration of the place of residence, an application for a tax number will also be submitted. A useful website [MyGermanExpert] (https://mygermanexpert.com/) will help you to fill out the registration form in English. Please note the issue of religion. Taxes are levied on adherents of many religions here, ranging from 2 to 4.5% of wages in different regions of the country. No tax is levied on atheists and Orthodox (Prüflink is required). 6) [Getting a tax number] (Taxes.md) He’ll come by mail to the registration address. In order to speed up the process, you can request it yourself after 7-10 working days by contacting your local tax office. Without this number, you will not be able to open a bank account (exception: online bank N26, there may be other online services) and will not be paid. 7) [Opening a bank account and getting a card] (Finance%20 and%20Banks.md) In large physical banks you usually need to make an appointment by phone or through the site in 4-5 working days. You should have a residence registration document, passport, tax number, wage contract with a German employer. You can open an account in online banks (e.g. N26) by phone or online, often no documents other than a passport are required. 8) [Health and social insurance] (Insurance.md) You can register by phone, online, or at the insurance company’s office, usually without an appointment. The most popular insurance among colleagues is [TK] (http://tk.de/). “Standard” insurance is compulsory, there is no big difference between insurance companies. Along with medical insurance you will also receive a social insurance number there. Both payments are automatically deducted from your salary 9) [Search for a permanent apartment] (Apartment%20 in question md) Topic for a separate conversation. Very much wishing on small areas and apartments without furniture. The most popular service for finding an apartment is [Immobilenscout24.de] (https://www.immobilienscout24.de/). 10) Filing for the Blue Card. The set of documents must be the same as for the visa at the embassy. In many cases this is the responsibility of the employer, all you have to do is show up at the right time to submit your fingerprints and the necessary formalities. You will be given a special paper stating that you have applied for the Blue Card. If your work visa expires sooner than you receive the Blue Card, you will need to show your passport and this paper when checking your documents. Leaving the EU territory or going through visa control when your visa expires and without the Blue Card, you will need to apply for a new visa [TODO check this information]. 11) Obtaining a Blue Card. Usually, the card is ready 3-6 weeks after its submission and must be picked up in person at the same office where it was submitted. You can congratulate yourself, challenge completed.

There are separate instructions for Blue Card, separate instructions for countries (Ukraine, etc.) First of all, it is necessary to fill in [online application] (http://anabin.kmk.org/antragsformular.html?L=1). There were problems with the registration of the application, it worked only in Internet Explorer under Windows. September 2017. Google Chrome for Windows 7 - no problems. December 2017. Google Chrome under Linux - everything works. In the field with a description of the purpose of the application you must write Blue Card (the application will be processed faster, with priority). Only if you have a contract. After submitting the application online, you will receive the generated application form in PDF format. File save, print, write date and sign by hand. If you make a mistake on the form, you will need to fill in the form again and get a new file with the correct data and a different application number. You won’t need the old one anymore, it’s better to delete it, so as not to accidentally mix it up. You need to attach it to your application: notarized copy of the diploma (apostille is not required) notarized copy of the diploma supplement (with grades) a notarized translation of the diploma into German a notarized translation of the Diploma Supplement into German A normal copy of the secondary school leaving certificate (no translation required) A regular copy of the appendix (with grades) to the secondary school leaving certificate a regular copy of the main page of the passport a regular copy of the contract for work in Germany (which must meet the criteria for a Blue Card) all previous diplomas of education (with annexes, only copies, without certification, without translations). As a rule, if you are applying for a specialist or master’s degree, you should also apply for a bachelor’s degree. If you had a special secondary education or something else, you should also apply for it; if the university is private - a regular copy of the certificate of accreditation of the university (without certification, without translation) if the name or surname has ever changed, copies of the change documents (without translation) if this does not follow from the diploma, a free-form certificate from the university about the form of education (day, evening, mixed, etc., without translation) As a rule, the translation agency already knows how to make and certify copies and translations for the embassy. You do not need to translate an international diploma (which includes information in English). A notarized copy of the diploma and the annex is sufficient. You put all this in an envelope and send it to Bonn by post (a detailed address will be given on the first page generated by the pdf form). When filling in the recipient’s data at the postal company’s office (e.g. DHL), it is necessary to fill in the recipient’s data in as much detail as possible (including the long name of the committee). September 2017. Courier services (DHL, Meest Express) refused delivery, arguing that as the recipient is just a mailbox and there is no contact person. Ukrposhta delivered in 8 days (by airmail, recommended letter). December 2017. In the Russian Federation, courier services also refuse to deliver to the PO Box. EMS (Russian Postal Service) delivered it about a week in advance. Later, ZAB referred to the unreliability of the Russian Post and offered to send a ready-made certificate to the address of the employer in Germany. After a few days you will receive an email saying that the documents have been received and it is time to pay for the service. It costs 200 euros (if you want, you can check several documents at once, then the first one is 200, the rest is 100). Money should be transferred to bank details abroad (SWIFT). The details will be indicated in an email message. I transferred money from the card of the Ukrainian Privatbank, then the bank called and checked why I was taking the money abroad, but eventually spent it. It may happen that payment by card in your bank will be impossible. Then there is the following solution. You open an account for an individual (physical person) in the currency of Euro, put 200 Euros in cash through the cash desk and 20 Euros of commission for SWIFT transfer at once. Come to your bank’s consultant and ask them to make a SWIFT transfer. You can specify the purpose of the payment as “External educational assessment services”. After the currency clearing (10 days according to the regulations, but in fact 1-2 days), your money will be credited to the account of the committee. Don’t forget to close this “auxiliary” euro account at the bank when you finish all the stages. If your bank does not know how to transfer money abroad, go to a larger bank (PrivatBank, Raiffeisen Bank Aval) and they will help you exactly. After that, you will receive another letter confirming your payment and the beginning of the assessment. As a result, you will receive a letter informing you that the documents were sent by regular mail to the address specified in the questionnaire. The application will include an electronic copy of the certificate. October 2017. It was enough to submit an electronic copy of the certificate to the embassy (sent by email to the embassy address with the case number). The original was not required. February 2017. Similarly, the Moscow embassy said it was enough to send them an email confirmation. Two days after sending, they issued a visa. And finally, you get the certificates of recognition by regular mail, two of them: a short form and a long form. You will also receive all the documents you originally submitted (copies of diplomas, etc.) Now you have an “analogue” of the German education and can safely use a short form (and if necessary, a full form) when applying for a job.

Emergency services (Notdienst) If you have an accident, such as a flood, or if you slam the door of your apartment leaving a key, be careful where you want to go to resolve your problem. In Germany, there are so-called emergency services (Notdiest), which specialise in urgent matters. The specificity of these services is that because of the urgency of the cost of the service can vary from a few dozen to many hundreds of euros, depending on the time when you call and the type of problem. There are cases when the company has invoiced the client for 700 euros, because the call of this service to open the door of the apartment where the key was left was made by the client after 21:00 pm. To reduce the risks, try to define your actions in advance during an emergency. Find out about the phones of proven emergency services that do their job for adequate money. Know your management company’s phone number, they may be the first to help you, especially if the problem occurs during normal business hours. Usually there is information from the management company with the phones at the entrance. It would be useful to ask your neighbors if they had any such cases, where they used to go, etc. If you call an emergency service, ask for a specific price for its services in your case. Unfortunately, this does not always save you from unexpected expenses, there are cases when the company, which, according to its website, works on both regular and urgent (accidents), sends an employee on the day of the call, despite the client’s assurances that there is no urgency in the order. At the end of the job, the employee bills the company for the emergency work because the call was made on the same day and the additional bill because the work was completed after 18 hours. If, in your opinion, the amount of services provided is too high, there are websites of lawyers who are engaged in consumer protection, for example https://verbraucherschutz.de. You can find consumer complaints of all kinds (“warnungen”) on such sites: https://verbraucherschutz.de/warnungen, including cases of notdienst. According to the information on the Internet, there are cases of successful court action in such cases: [Geld zurück bei Wucher] (http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/ausgesperrt-geld-zurueck-bei-wucher-1.566766). This December 2017 article describes the price abuse by Schlüsseldienste and gives an overview of the prices of door opening services in Germany: [Schlüsseldienste: So viel darf eine Türöffnung kosten] (https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/wissen/umwelt-haushalt/wohnen/schluesseldienste-so-viel-darf-eine-tueroeffnung-kosten-6687). Often the affected customers are foreigners who do not speak German. Lack of language skills can have a major impact on the adequacy of their assessment of the company with which they conclude the contract. Also, in case of fraud, it is usually much more difficult for a foreigner to start legal proceedings with such a company than for a local or settled in Germany: due to ignorance of the language, laws, lack of appropriate connections, etc. Keywords for finding relevant information: Notdienst or Schluesseldienst “locksmith”, “rip-off” “falsch” “verbraucher”",

    "content": "Invitation It is possible to invite your friends or relatives to your home in Germany, which allows them to submit fewer documents than is generally required when applying for a visa. There are two types of invitations - informal and official (Verpflichtungserklärung). In the case of an official invitation, you are the guarantor of your guest and are responsible for him/her during his/her stay in Germany. This includes accommodation (no hotel reservations required), financial sponsorship (no bank statement required), health insurance and repatriation. This is an official document and will require the original invitation when applying for a visa (i.e. you will need to mail it to them). An informal invitation only relieves the guest of the need to provide the hotel reservation to the embassy, which is often sufficient, as there are known cases where the embassy monitors the status of the reservation and may even cancel the visa already issued if it finds out that the reservation has been cancelled. However, this is no longer an issue with the invitation. Unofficial invitation Written in English or German, with the dates of the trip, your passport details and address, passport details and the home address of the guest, signed and scanned. The received scan is sent to the guest together with the scan of your passport and the BC and with these printouts the guest will go for a visa (of course, this does not relieve the guest of the need to have all the other documents required to apply for a visa).

General information On the application form, you must specify at least the starting date of your Beginn der voraussichtlichen Visumgültigkeit am visa.

For multiple visits, it is necessary to write in the box what Multivisa, for example, requires: 15.10.2016 Multivisa für 2 Jahre. Then the “Planned length of stay” column of the invitation will contain something like a gewünscht Multivisa für 2 Jahre. In one invitation you can specify the spouse of the invited person and his or her minor children. If you wish to submit an invitation, you should also attach a handwritten invitation, which is always welcome at the embassies. If the wife does not work to invite her parents, the invitation is from her husband. The wife should write a handwritten letter to the embassy, similar to an invitation.

Often they just look for employees in xing-es or other social networks. As a rule, a recruiter does not work with companies that are not ready to pay for his services.

A recruiter, in order to interest the employer, can greatly embellish the candidate, as a result of which the gap between reality can increase significantly. There are recruiters who publish very unrealistic vacancies, and then, when you write to them, they start offering something else. Companies sit their HR’s, of course it is beneficial for them to present the closing of the position as their own merit, because it is their direct responsibility. An HR who closes a position completely by himself raises less questions about his usefulness than a candidate can find only through an intermediary. Recruiters most likely increase the legal entropy of companies, not all of them are eager to conduct legal expertise of additional contracts with recruiters, and to sign that no one will take responsibility either. This point is questionable, as to who has settled through recruiters, will bring clarity. ####### Salary expectations ########## For In the area of healthy eating, you say your expectations. The recruiter may advise you above or below, but he or she will give your wish to the client. (You don’t have to tell the truth, nobody checks. The last two works I have done are waiting for +10-15k or said that it makes sense to change if there is more than X) ########## Against Recruiters receive remuneration depending on the salary of the future employee. As a result, some of them persuade you to lower your salary expectations in order to increase your chances of getting a job and getting a reward, while others, on the contrary, overstate your expectations in order to increase your reward. In case of understatement the company will naturally have a question: either the person has greatly embellished, or does not know how to assess himself. All this does not add points to your candidacy. In case of overestimation, the company will naturally prefer to hire a person for whom there is no need to pay the recruiters, and who does not have overestimation of salary expectations. The percentage of refusals with recruiters will be higher. Working in Germany without higher education It is possible to find a job in Germany without a university degree. However, it is not possible to get a Blue Card without higher education. To obtain a work permit for people without higher education, you must obtain a so-called German national visa type D. The process of obtaining this visa without the Blue Card is, on average, more complicated and time-consuming than the same process for professionals with higher education who apply for the Blue Card, and can take a total of at least two months. The German authorities are rumoured to be considering a law that would replace the mandatory requirement for higher education with a 5-year work experience in the relevant field, but from personal experience in March 2015 (Russian specialist) and April 2016 (Brazilian specialist), the actual requirement for the Blue Card is higher education. According to unverified data, German companies usually try to avoid candidates without higher education precisely because of the increased complexity of the process and take up employment of such candidates only if the candidates are really of particular value to them (a real example: 2 specialists without higher education in a company with 200 employees). In addition, the company’s willingness to employ candidates without higher education may depend on the company’s existing experience with such employment. If this process is established, the candidate will have to do almost nothing, because all instructions will be provided by the company, otherwise the candidate and the company will get this experience together with the German authorities and Russian/Ukrainian embassies. There is an organization [Berlin Partner] (http://www.berlin-partner.de/en/our-services/talent-services/), which helps companies with employment of foreign specialists. If the company cooperates with the Berlin Partner, the patronage of the Berlin Partner in the case of a candidate without higher education significantly increases the probability that the visa will be issued to him. After receiving the offer from a German company, among the documents for a visa, the candidate without higher education, except for the offer itself, it is desirable to have the following documents: The so-called “motivational” letter from the company, in which it is written that the company knows that the candidate has no higher education, but that, despite this, the candidate is very, very valuable to the company as a potential employee. Motivation letter from Berlin Partner, which also states that the employee is very valuable for the German economy, despite his lack of higher education. Various documents that confirm the solidity of the company itself, its importance for the German economy. Personal experience (spring 2015): The process took 6 months: from obtaining the offer to going to work. In my case, the company did not have the experience of employing foreign specialists without higher education, so it took the first month and a half out of six months for the company to make a series of enquiries to the German authorities as to whether such employment was possible and the subsequent expectations of answers. The final answer did not say yes or no: “You should apply for a Type D national visa in your country and wait for an answer about the possibility of issuing a postal certificate from the German embassy or consulate in your country. All documents have been submitted, including motivation letters from the company and Berlin Partner. We had to wait two and a half months out of the two promised. When it became clear that something was going wrong, because there was no positive or negative answer, the company contacted the German authorities by phone and found out that my documents were stashed in a stack of dubious candidates, which was not disassembled in time. After that, I had to wait about a month and a half more, and finally, the positive answer came. My case was obviously exceptional, as the deadline was delayed due to some bureaucratic delay, but it was not obvious at the time of waiting and gave rise to a lot of worries and doubts about the possibility of successful completion of this enterprise. P.S. I only met one Brazilian colleague in the company who had no higher education, but I do not conclude that the case of a specialist without higher education is extremely rare. Later, when I was already in Germany, when I had the opportunity to interview other candidates, the first question my HR colleagues asked me about them was, “Does this candidate have a higher education?” and when I asked them why they were interested, they said that it was much easier for them to work with candidates with a higher education. From personal experience (autumn 2018): Introduction: The company is American, so all correspondence is in English and without problems. The company has extensive experience in working with foreigners and has dedicated people for this purpose. There is a paragraph about 5 years of experience as a substitute for HE - http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aufenthg_2004/__19a.html But the relocation specialist said she couldn’t use it. You can try it on the spot (in Germany) (change your work visa to Blue Card). According to the Blue Card, I did not have a Blue Card, so we decided to make a national work visa. The additional documents are “approval from Federal Employment Agency” - “ANTRAG AUF ERLAUBNIS EINER BESCHÄFTIGUNG (unselbstständige Erwerbstätigkeit), die der Zustimmung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit bedarf”. This took 2.5 weeks (plus a week by mail), during which time I was able to translate all the necessary documents. The document is, as I understand it, important. Served in Minsk. The visa was ready in less than a week. There was no interview with the consul or request for additional documents. The process took 1.5 months from the moment of consent to the offer to the visa in the passport. Dismissal Nuances notice period Generally, German contracts require a three-month notice period. But in addition, this period starts at the beginning of the calendar month. That is, let’s say, there is no difference, you wrote a letter of resignation on December 2 or December 29. Three months will start counting down on January 1 in both cases. Accordingly, it is important to choose the time when to start looking for a job. Your resume is usually accompanied by your salary expectations and the date on which you can start working. If you don’t want to take risks and find a job first, and then quit, you can get into a situation where you wrote to the company on January 20th that you can go to work in early May, while an interview was scheduled, while it was held, now waiting for a decision and a possible offer, but approaching the end of the month, and you either write a letter of resignation and take on additional risks, or write to the company that your possible date of employment shifts, which may cause rejection. In addition to this, there may be nuances with the confirmation of the application for dismissal. If you submit it, say, on the 29th of the day, and send confirmation can already in the next month, which, accordingly, can also violate your plans, not the fact that the countdown will start from the date when you signed the application, and not when it was signed by a responsible person. That is, you may find yourself in a situation where you have signed a new contract on a certain date, and can not fulfill it due to obligations to the current contract. Arbeitslosengeld (ALG) If you do not wish to be dismissed, you will be given a termination letter stating the date of the last working day. Once you have received the letter, you can register with Arbeitsagentur to apply for benefits. This is required: 1) The letter of termination itself 2) “Residence”, Meldebescheinigung 3) Passport and residence permit, e.g. Bluecard 4) Have more than 1 year of work experience in Germany 5) The possibility of explaining oneself in German, as this agency refuses to speak English flatly. Or call someone who can, with himself. Further in agency will explain what to do, will give papers on filling in, the login-password to a personal office. An important point is that you will receive the Arbeitsbescheinigung - a certificate of where you worked, how much you worked and with what salary. The certificate must be from all the jobs in the last three years. You can get it by contacting the companies where you worked. Usually HR doesn’t prioritize these papers too much, and you can wait 1 to 3 weeks for them. As long as these documents are not uploaded to Arbeitsagentur portal at least, the allowance will not be paid, although the days you have spent without work and will be counted and paid. The amount of the allowance is about 60% of your net salary and the social and insurance contributions for you will be paid in the same way as the employer did.",

    "content": "Residence registration You must register within 14 days of moving to a new place of residence in Germany. This is only necessary for long-term stays (more than two months); short-term stays, e.g. in hotels, do not have to be registered. Without registration, it is usually difficult or impossible to open a bank account, obtain health insurance, a residence permit, etc. Theoretically, if you miss the registration deadline, there may be consequences in the form of a fine, etc. In practice, this does not happen or rarely happens. Basic information The German registration of the place of residence is called Anmeldung einer Wohnung. Do not confuse the name with Abmeldung einer Wohnung: the name differs from the Abmeldung einer Wohnung: it is one letter, but it means the opposite - deregistration (discussed below). The official service page: Berlin - https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/, Munich - https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/Buergerbuero/Wohnen/An–und-Ummelden.html - always check it before you register. Useful Print this page on paper (use the [Als PDF herunterladen] link (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/pdf/) and print the pdf file you received) and take it with you to the registration process. In case of a dispute (e.g. a Bürgeramt employee refuses to register you if your address belongs to another Bürgeramt), take out the paper and appeal to it, point out specific places in the text with your finger (of course, the text must be read in advance). Documents and requirements Personal presence Registration is only possible with personal reception, online, by fax or by mail. Family members living together are registered together. However, if the family members are still coming to Germany, it is not possible to register them: first you register yourself and the family members register after you arrive. There is conflicting information about whether one person can come and register the whole family. On the service page it is stated that the registration can be carried out by a legal representative (but it is not clear whether a marriage or birth certificate is sufficient), provided that the person to be registered has signed the form himself/herself. In other words, it may be possible, but it may also require the presence of all registered family members. It is believed that everyone should come to the first registration, and on subsequent moves it is enough for someone to come alone. In the end, if there is a possibility for everyone to come, it is better for everyone to come. Personal documents Identity documents (passports, travel documents of the child) of all persons who are registered. Visas, residence permits, if they are executed separately from the passport, it is also better to bring them with you. Family status documents: marriage certificates, birth certificates of children. If not issued in Germany, with an apostille. If not in German, with translation. On the official service page it is stated that this is only required for the first registration, but it is better to take it for the following ones as well. The formulary As of March 2017, no forms are required in Munich, you are asked a few questions and everything is entered in the database. You need to fill in form. You can download it and fill it out on your computer, then print it out and sign it. It can be printed blank and filled by hand. As a last resort, you can take the blank form from Bürgeramt and fill it in there. If you registered before November 2015, please note that the form has changed**! This used to be a few pages with instructions, a page with an application form and another page with a certificate form that was issued after registration. Now it is one page with the application form, and it differs significantly from the previous one. One form can be used to record the data of one person or two family members (e.g. husband and wife). When you register two people, you must enter the relationship between them in the column Familienstand. The date, city and country of registration of the marriage or partnership must be entered next to the spouse or life partner. If more than two family members are registered at the same time, several forms must be filled in (two persons each). Fill in the form as follows In the Neue Wohnung box, enter the address of the accommodation you are entering. In the Die neue Wohnung ist box, you should note alleinige Wohnung unless you have several places to live in Germany (see below). Tag des Einzugs - date of entry. Postleitzahl, Gemeinde, Ortsteil - postcode and city (e.g. 10,000 Berlin). Straße, Hausnummer, Zusätze - street, house number. And if you do not have your name on the [mailbox] (post.md) (usually when you sublet for several months), be sure to enter the name on the box in the form bei Müller or c/o Müller. In the Bisherige Wohnung box, you must enter the previous address at which you were registered in Germany. If this is your first registration in Germany, you do not need to enter your foreign address (you may be asked to complete it then), but you must enter the country of origin in the box Bei Zuzug aus dem Ausland Staat. Wird die bisherige Wohnung beibehalten and Haben die unten aufgeführten Personen noch weitere Wohnungen in Deutschland? The person information block is filled in as follows. Familienname - surname, Vornamen - name (according to the passport; in particular, if the patronymic is indicated in the passport, it should be specified in Vornamen, and if not specified, it is not necessary). Geburtsname - if the person had a different surname at birth (e.g. the wife took the surname of her husband), it should be indicated here, otherwise the field should be left blank. Geschlecht - sex (männlich or weiblich). Tag, Ort, Land der Geburt - date, city and country of birth. Religionsgesellschaft - religious affiliation. This is very important because if you specify one of the taxable religions (e.g. Catholicism), a significant percentage of the church tax will be withheld from your monthly salary (8-9% of the income tax, which can be several hundred euros per year)! You can leave the field blank, or specify keine (no), or draw a dash, or specify, for example, Orthodoxy (which is not taxed). Staatsangehörigkeiten - your citizenship (e.g. ukrainisch). If you have more than one citizenship, you must state everything. The Ordens-Künstlername is a religious or artistic nickname that can be officially registered in Germany and you probably do not have it. In the Dokumente box, the first and second person, respectively, need to enter the identity card data with which you came. For your passport, write RP in the column Art. Ausstellungsbehörde - the name of the issuing institution (in Ukrainian passports in this field only the number of the body is indicated, German officials may be embarrassed, in this case you can specify: Behörde 1234). Seriennummer - number (including series). Datum - date of issue, gültig bis - date of expiry. Documents from the landlord The rental contract is not officially included in the list of documents required for registration. However, it is sometimes asked and watched. Therefore, it is worth taking it with you. In Munich in March 2017, no contracts were asked for, just a passport and Wohnungsgeberbestätigung (see details below). You also need to bring a separate document from your landlord that confirms that you have entered your home. This is a new requirement from November 2015. However, the rental agreement does not replace this document. There is a misconception that this new document is a residence permit from your landlord; of course, it is not, and no one can prevent you from registering. But in addition to the tenancy agreement (which confirms your right to live in the apartment), the landlord must confirm that you have really started living there. There is no strict form for this document. It can be called, for example, Einzugsbestätigung des Wohnungsgebers or Wohnungsgeberbestätigung. On the official website of the registration service there is a sample: [Berlin] (http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402544) or [Munich] (http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/fachspezifisch/HA-II/Buergerbuero/Dokumente/Wohnungsgeberbest-tigung_Internet.pdf). It is not mandatory. Landlords may be unfamiliar with this new requirement and may sometimes refuse to issue such a document, or they may only issue it to the tenant and not to their family members. You should insist on your own and, if necessary, resort to legal assistance. The official registration page states that the landlord is obliged to issue this document according to the new law. Experience of 16 September 2018: When he requested Wohnungsgeberbestätigung from the landlord for his wife, he said that I could now issue the document myself, as I was already registered in the apartment. Bürgeramt clarified this question and said it was true. Anyone who is already registered in the apartment can fill out this form. I filled in for my wife, there were no problems with registration. Reception To register, you must go to any Bürgeramt** (Bürgeramt) in person, regardless of your address. There are situations where officials try to refuse to register people if the address does not belong to the Bürgeramt. You have to insist and demand. The official service page clearly states: Diese Anmeldung können Sie bei einem der über 40 Berliner Bürgerämter erledigen. Munich: Central Bürgerbüro: Kreisverwaltungsreferat (KVR) is located at Ostbahnhof station, the exact address is Orleansstraße 50. It was not possible to sign up online, so everyone gets tickets and waits in line. As of March 2017, you can expect a waiting time of about 2 hours for your turn, so it makes no sense to come back later than 2 hours before closing (normal opening time up to 12 hours). upd. October 17: In the office, where it is useless to come in terms of terms, for the next month or two it is all sorted out. At Bürgerbüro Riesenfeldstraße, the whole process took less than 2 hours and came 10 minutes before opening. The rental contract was not asked. upd. August 18: Half an hour before the opening, many terms appear online in all Bürgerbüro today, and you can choose almost any convenient time. Berlin: The biggest problem is getting to the reception. There are two options: go by appointment (Termin) or in a live queue. Recently, the possibility to come in order of the live queue is removed, in some Bürgeramt still possible. You can sign up for Termin on the [official service page] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/) by clicking the big blue button “Termin berlinweit suchen”. However, there are few terms and they run out quickly. Therefore, if possible, it is necessary to register as early as possible, one and a half months before the move, but this does not guarantee the receipt of the term (you can not register for more than two months in advance, and the terms for two months are immediately disassembled). The only option is to periodically (several times per hour) check the availability of terms, they can appear when someone cancels their term. Get ready when you see a term available to you to specify your name and email very quickly - if you don’t get there in time, the term will go to someone else. It makes sense to check in the early morning hours, because Bürgeramt can throw a bunch of new free terms into the system. There are some scripts for automated catching of terms (e.g. PHP script), but they can be used to quickly get into a ban. There is, or was, a term-catching startup that operates on a similar principle, and was fought by the authorities. There is an unofficial [iOS-appendix] (https://burgeramtapp.com) notifying of the emergence of new terms. It is also possible to make an appointment on the phone. A colleague who speaks German well should be asked to call the number indicated on the website and find out the time of the nearest free term. You may be lucky enough to make your appointment on the same day. The fact is that not all Bürgeramt are connected to the online automated booking system. You can only make a reservation over the phone. In addition, some Bürgeramt book terms for local residents. Once you receive the term, you will receive the date and time of the reception and the term number. It should be noted that the availability of the term does not guarantee admission at the specified time. You can come with the term and sit for an hour and a half after the appointed time, with people coming in line and being accepted in fifteen minutes. At the same time, it is useless to complain or try to get into the live queue. The second option is to come without a term, in the order of the live queue. Bürgeramt, which take without a term, is left a little, but they are. You should see the Bürgeramt list on the [official service page] (https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/): The name of the Bürgeramt leads to a page with a description of the reception hours. If it says nur mit Termin or nur für Terminkunden next to the reception hours, you will not be accepted without the term. You should also read other texts on the Bürgeramt website, e.g. that they will only accept locals without a term. **” Experience of June 14, 2016: In Bürgeramt [Bürgeramt Reinickendorf-Ost] (https://service.berlin.de/standort/122311/) we managed to make a registration without a term and without a number: along with the offices, which are accepted by term/numbers, there was a separate office with a very long queue of those who came without a term. If you can come without a term, then at the entrance to the Bürgeramt you will get a term number for today. (But it is possible that it is not for today, in this case nothing can be done.) With the term number (obtained in advance or at the Bürgeramt), you must wait at the Bürgeramt until this number is shown on the scoreboard. Immediately after that, you should come to the table, the number of which will be shown along with the number of your term. Evidence of registration At the reception you will be given a document confirming your registration right away: Meldebestätigung. It will contain the names of the registered persons, the address of residence, the date of entry and the date of issue of the document. The document is signed by an official and sealed with the Bürgeramt seal. This document should be carried with you when you apply to various institutions such as banks, insurance companies, etc. Some agencies require the document to be relatively recent (issued in the last three, six months, or even two weeks). The official service page is: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120702/ This is a paid service, it costs 10 € when issuing a document for one person. You can ask for family members to be included in the document, in which case there will be an additional fee of 5 € for each person (but only the first person will be detailed information, the rest will be listed briefly). If you need to get this document, you can get it in the following ways: Go back to the Bürgeramt (same or different) and ask for a new document: Meldebescheinigung (means and contains essentially the same, but the title and form of this document are different). It is possible to appoint Termin, it is possible to try to go without it, but not the fact that it will turn out to receive service at once on a place Order Meldebescheinigung remotely (post or email). This procedure is described on the official service page. Briefly: You will need to pay the required amount to your Bürgeramt account (details available here: http://www.berlin.de/labo/_assets/buergerdienste/bankverbindungen-der-buergeraemter.pdf). In free form, you can request an e-mail address from Bürgeramt at your place of registration by attaching a scan of your BK/NE. You will soon receive an email confirming that your request has been processed and that Meldebescheinigung will be sent by post. An example of the text of the request: Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, hier bitte ich Ihnen um meine Meldebescheinigung mich zuschicken. Die Kopie meiner Aufenthaltserlaubnis könnten Sie im Anhang finden. Am 30.10.18 habe ich 10 EUR an Pankower Behörde (Postbank) überwiesen. Meine Postanschrift lautet: &lt;Name, Familienname&gt;, Danke sehr im Voraus. In addition to these two documents, the address of residence is also indicated on the back of the residence permit in the form of a card (see below). In some cases, it may be sufficient to show the card to confirm the address. Moving away If you are already registered in Germany and are moving to a new address, you do not need to cancel the previous address separately, just register the new one in the usual way. You will need to enter your previous address in the Bisherige Wohnung block on the form. After the registration of the new place of residence, the information about it is transferred to a central database, and from there it can be received by the interested institutions and enterprises, such as [ABH] (ABH.md), [insurance companies] (Insurance.md), [banks] (Finance%20 and%20Banks.md), etc. Therefore, it may not be necessary to inform them about it at all (but it is better to contact the insurance company, bank and check that they know your new address, if necessary, send them a confirmation of registration). For example, the insurance company will automatically re-issue your card and send it to a new address. Previously, you could indicate on the registration form whether or not you want to be notified to third parties. Accordingly, it was possible to prohibit it, and then you had to inform the insurance company, the bank, etc. about the move yourself. There is no such option in the new form. If someone still has your old address, they can send you letters (including very important ones). You can activate a paid [mail forwarding service] (https://www.efiliale.de/efiliale/nachsenden-lagern/nachsendeservice.jsp?cid=DP_101002152) to a new address within 6, 12 or 24 months. If you have a residence permit in the form of a card, you need to go to [ABH] (ABH.md) with your residence permit and proof of residence registration. ABH will stick a free sticker with a new address (over the old address) on the back of the card. If you happen to have registered a new address after you have applied for a residence permit and before you receive it, the residence permit (if issued in the form of a card) will have the old address on it. In this case, take the confirmation of registration when you go to receive the card and immediately ask for a new address. Check out You should only cancel your place of residence (“check out”) in the following cases: you will no longer live in Germany you have [multiple residences] (#Number of residences) and one of them is the one you stop living in. You do not need to cancel your registration when you [move] (#Moving). The deregistration service is called Abmeldung einer Wohnung (not to be confused with Anmeldung einer Wohnung - residence registration). The official service page is: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120335/ Unlike residence registration, it is possible to deregister without personal reception by sending documents by mail. It is allowed to cancel the registration not earlier than 7 days before and not later than 14 days after departure. Several places of residence You can officially register several places of residence. In this case, you must declare one of them as the main place of residence (Hauptwohnung) and the others as an additional place of residence (Nebenwohnung). On the residence registration form, you indicate that you are keeping your previous place of residence and that you are registering a new one as Hauptwohnung or Nebenwohnung. Or you leave your old address and register several new ones at the same time. You must also submit [another form] (http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402610).",

Some Landlords require a Privathaftpflichtversicherung and Hausratversicherung from the tenant. All other insurances are required depending on the lifestyle, risks and health conditions, as well as the availability of pets All insurances should be carefully read the terms and conditions, plus understand that such contracts in Germany are usually eternal, that is, they will be extended until obviously will not be made Kündigung (usually in 3 months). Health insurance All German residents are required to have health insurance that meets German standards. These standards are not satisfied with travel insurance, which, if a person broke his leg, pay for his or her way home to the hospital. There are two types of health insurance, GKV and PKV. Most people are required to be in the GKV system, but some people are allowed to switch to the PKV system. In the GKV (“gesetzliche” = “legal”, socialism) you pay according to your possibilities (a certain percentage of your income) and get it according to your needs (there is no money involved in going to the doctor). If you have a lot of money (salary &gt; Versicherungspflichtgrenze = 59,400.00 € in 2018), the state allows you to switch to the PKV system. In the PKV system (private, private, capitalism) you pay according to the actuarial risk calculated by the company, and the doctors issue invoices, which have to be paid for themselves and then receive the insurance money to the account. In the PKV, you can play with a franchise, partial coverage (e.g., 90%), or various buns (“chief physician’s service”). We could discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the GKV and PKV here, but practically private insurance companies will not take a person who hasn’t treated all his diseases in Germany for a couple of years. In addition, they will ask for a medical examination and will think for a few months. So if you have just arrived in Germany, you will only be affected by the GKV system. Nevertheless, you need to know about the existence of the PKV system, for example, because the person who gets more than the specified limit in the documents is marked as freiwillig versichert (and if less, pflichtversichert). This does not mean that you can simply refuse insurance or not pay - only that you can try to switch to the PKV system if you wish. This is a separate and large topic. Practical steps for newcomers Before or after arrival (but it is better before the nervous HR starts running in circles and saying that he can’t pay his salary) you should choose one of the insurance companies GKV and write to them about yourself and your favorite family members. Since the job will be paid from the first day of work, the insurance will also be valid from that time, even if the process of joining will be delayed (moreover, the insurance is obliged to accept the person and pay the post fact that he has already been to the doctor during this period). The end result of the process will be a standard card [EHIC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Health_Insurance_Card), and you will present it when visiting a doctor. If necessary, go without it, you will have to leave the address and data of the insurance company and try to bring the card within 10 days (but exactly within a quarter, otherwise you will have to pay the doctor himself). What is the difference between insurance companies in the GKV system? By law, they take almost the same money: 14.6 + (about 1)% = X% of (income up to a certain limit) and provide almost the same services. A small difference can be in: Payments for homeopathy, acupuncture, etc. Healthy lifestyle bonuses, e.g. 100 euros per year Paying for health courses, e.g. 200 euros per year the percentage of payment for complex dental surgeries How to choose an insurance company in the GKV system? [Techniker Krankenkasse, TK] (https://tk.de) have a reputation for being the most scientific, but this reputation is slightly exaggerated, for example [they were among the first to pay for homeopathy] (http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/kosten-nutzen-rechnung-krankenkassen-kaempfen-fuer-homoeopathie-a-706336.html) [AOK] (https://aok.de) is a historical local cash register, founded in 1884 as a cash register, which took all (at the time when most of it was organized by professions) there’s actually a lot of them, it’s better to look at check24 If you don’t like the company, you can change it in 18 months. Insurance in GKV of people without work Typical cases: the spouse/child of the person being paid into the system without their own income: since X% of 0 = 0, free Mitversicherung (with some small amount of income equated to 0) was an employee, but became unemployed without income: it is necessary to pay a small amount of money, depending on the situation it is possible that the first month is not necessary to pay officially receives ALG I/II: insurance is paid as part of the benefit Self-employed, lives on interest from shares, won the lottery, other income: you have to pay X% on your own you have moved from the EU country to look for a job and have been in public insurance before: the previous insurance is valid or the GKV takes care of it for a small sum of money you did not move from the EU to look for a job: the consulate had to explain the topic in detail, up to 6 months is enough travel insurance (which does not cover everything), more than 6 months will not be allowed to live Does my health insurance work outside Germany? in the EU? In most cases, yes, but it is better to check it before you travel by typing in the search engine “EHIC name of the EU country”. It does not depend on the insurance company. outside the EU? No, but there are exceptions that depend on the insurance company. For example, TK health insurance covers medical expenses when travelling to [Turkey or Tunisia] (https://www.tk.de/tk/beratung/schutz-im-ausland/ausserhalb-euroas/348470). You can use [Envivas] (https://envivas.de) to extend coverage for normal [TC] (https://tk.de), which extends the coverage of normal TC insurance to the whole world. There are two types: [individual] (https://www.envivas.de/en/products-and-services/supplementary-insurances/travellling-abroad/travelxn) and [family] (https://www.envivas.de/en/products-and-services/supplementary-insurances/travellling-abroad/travelxf). In the event that regular health insurance does not work, you can buy travel insurance by comparing the prices at [check24.de] (https://www.check24.de/reiseversicherung). You will be interested in Reisekranken, although there are many comprehensive offers for travelers. Trevelhack: [The Miles&amp;More Frequent Traveler Bonus Program] (https://www.miles-and-more.com/online/portal/mam/de/homepage) offers a credit card standard Mastercard Gold, which includes travel insurance + a full hull insurance for the rental car paid by the card. Insurance tracking There is a service for monitoring the existing insurances and their optimization in terms of price and volume of services - the company [clark.de] (https://www.clark.de/de/invitation/8hvwkbv2gh). Prices of offers can be interesting, especially in comparison with the aggregator [check24.de] (https://check24.de). Mechanism of operation - you provide the type of insurance and the name of the company, clark makes a request on your behalf upon your request and receives the policy numbers and current insurance terms and conditions. There is a recommendation service that will analyze the terms of your insurance and market offerings - and offer three options. The service requires a good knowledge of German, because all contracts and the interface itself are provided in German. Where can I choose and compare insurances? You can choose and compare them at http://www.check24.de, http://www.verivox.de You can find out about all kinds of tricks and more about insurance points (for example, what is Hotelkosten in Hausratversicherung) at http://www.finanztip.de/ What is Rechtsschutzversicherung and what’s it for? Lawyer’s insurance - Rechtsschutzversicherung, has a number of essential nuances and very ambiguous reviews. Basically, for the decision of questions with the employer, landlord or in case of an accident. Insurance coverage is not provided to the client in case of intentional violation of the law. A criminal offence has been committed and the accused urgently needs legal protection. At first glance, the crime is committed not intentionally, but because of negligence. The defendant used the services of a lawyer at the expense of insurance, but in the process of conducting the case, the prosecutor presents indisputable evidence of intentionality of the crime committed, and then the judge makes the appropriate decision. From that moment on, the insurance cover is terminated and the accused is obliged to reimburse the insurance company for all expenses incurred.",

The letter will contain the amount of €17.50 (per month) - that’s how much you pay for broadcasting. The fee of 17.50* Euro per month covers all public service television and radio broadcasts regardless of the mode of transmission and ensures free access to a wide range of programmes for all individuals. In other words, it is your civic contribution to the support and development of public television and radio. It is a pseudo-tax, which is a de facto mandatory payment. The amount is asked from the apartment, not the number of residents (relevant for students). If there are more than one apartment, the payment is made for each one. The sequence of actions If you agree with the payment offer, you must confirm your agreement. This can be done in two ways: The best way to do this is to [fill in the form on the website] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/formulare/anmelden/index_ger.html) online. the same thing, but in a paper form - to fill in the form, which was attached in the letter, to sign and send back. It is advisable to send the so-called einwurf einschreiben, i.e. a letter with a confirmation of receipt. This is to ensure that the letter is not lost and that you do not have to pay fines after some time. Some time after registration, you will receive another letter in the top right corner which will include your nine-digit Beitragsnummer - don’t lose it - it is needed to transfer the money, and it will also need to be indicated by other family members at и или co-habitants as proof that the apartment has already been paid for. During registration, you will also be asked to choose how often you want to pay - in the middle of the quarter, at the end of the quarter, every six months or once a year. There are two payment options - the first is Direct Debit, when you give your company your consent to withdraw money from your card, and the company withdraws when and how much it needs. The second one, more familiar to people from the former Soviet Union, is a transfer to an account. On [the site] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/bankverbindung/index_ger.html) you can find out the necessary details for payment (they are also specified in the paper letter with the invoice) and transfer money to them regularly. Attention - do not forget to specify your Beitragsnummer in the explanation to the payment. If you move into another apartment and receive a new application form or if you register in the new tenant’s apartment, and he or she starts to receive “letters of happiness”, you should indicate the existing number (Beitragsnummer) in the application form, according to which the payment is already made. Then the same thing happens - fill out a form on the website or print it out, sign and send a paper form. Importantly. If you are leaving Germany, or are moving to another apartment where tax is already being paid, you should notify the company to avoid continuing to drip tax. This can also be done via [website] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/formulare/abmelden/index_ger.html). If you do not agree with the offer of payment_ (or the amount), you can claim [benefits or cancellation of payment] (https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/informationen/menschen_mit_behinderung/index_ger.html). Here](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/formulare/buergerinnen_und_buerger/antrag_auf_befreiung/index_ger.html) you can choose the reason for the refusal. Most residents do have to pay this tax.

    "content": "Banks Warning Each credit card application will be displayed in SCHUFA for 3 years. General information In Germany, banks can be online and online+offline Online banks are usually free of charge, but online+offline banks are currently withdrawing some monthly service fee. In some banks this amount is quite immodest. Advantages of online + offline bank - you can communicate in person, go to the office, etc. It is considered more reliable and of high quality with a wide network of ATMs, but you have to pay. In general, look for that more suitable for you on the ratio of price to quality. To open a bank account, you need to register. Some banks can open an account without registration (Deutsche Bank in 2013), but this is an exception, you can try, but there are no guarantees. The chances of an employment contract and a recent arrival in Germany are greatly increased (Deutsche Bank opened an account on 03.03.16 at Alexanderstraße 5, 10178 Berlin). Also opened in Commerzbank, which is near the zoo, 29.02.2016. This required a passport with a visa and a work contract. Instead of a home address, he indicated the address of the office. The procedure took an hour. Cards and PIN codes were promised to be sent to the office. Features of cards EC Karte (Girocard, VPay) - an internal payment system, introduced in Germany as a simple answer to the high Visa/Mastercard fees, is widely used in public institutions to pay duties or penalties Opening an online bank account In the English-speaking segment of the Internet there are [step-by-step instructions] (http://banks-germany.com/best-german-bank-account) for opening an account in online banks (such as Ing-Diba, DKB, Comdirect). As a rule, the procedure of account opening consists in filling in the online form, which generates a PDF file that you print, sign and send to the specified address. Besides you should pass identification procedure. As a rule, online banks provide a choice of two options for identification: Video identification or identification in the post office. In N26 biometric passport of the Russian Federation is suitable for video identification. A five-year Russian passport (without biometrics) cannot be identified online There is a good experience of video identification in N26 with Ukrainian passports (see #147). **Important: **For successful online identification you need a stable and fast Internet, as well as a quiet environment, otherwise the procedure may be interrupted for technical reasons, or at the initiative of the inspector. The remaining option is identification at the post office. The procedure is free of charge. To pass the procedure you should take your passport, PDF file with the code of postal identification, which was received at the last stage of registration at the bank, a document of residence registration. So you go to the post office of Deutsche Post and provide the employee with the documents. The Deutsche Post employee checks your details and generates a letter that is sent to the bank. It’s simple, but there may be a problem with the place of birth indicated in your passport. For example, in the Ukrainian passport the place of birth in some cases is not printed in Latin letters due to the long name (for example: Dnipropetrovsk region /UKR). An employee of Deutche Post may refuse to identify him/her. Go to another department, where you will most likely not be refused, but will be offered to write your place of birth in Latin letters. You can show the first page of the contract with the bank, as you have already entered this information when opening an account. Make sure that the signatures in your passport and documents match. Otherwise, the identification procedure may be terminated by refusal. Attention! He was one of the first clients of this bank. But there was a problem with N26 Black: I refused this service because it was completely useless back in July, we received a confirmation letter - yes, we canceled N26 Black, but in fact - in October I continue to pay for the month when I closed my account in N26 at all and I can’t use the card, because it’s been cut for a long time. At first, the support service insisted that I had to pay for another year, and after presenting their letter of cancellation, they gave me a back-up one, and insisted not to close the account.

Commerzbank experience: free of charge in the branch, without a term, in 2 minutes, and only in German. Currency exchange Strange as it may seem, it will be most advantageous to change the currency in Russia/Ukraine. Coming to the EU with dollars is an unfavorable idea because of very unpleasant exchange rates.

The bank cannot credit cash USD to the account in USD without double conversion. Stock market Many banks (Deutsche Bank, ING-DiBa, etc.) are also forward market brokers, allowing you to buy shares on world stock exchanges directly through your Internet bank. The procedure of opening an investment account takes from a couple of days (Direkt-Depot from ING-DiBa) to several months, including lost letters and other jams from the bank (maxBlue from Deutsche Bank). Commissions for the operation are very high - about 25 euros per operation, i.e. these services are designed for long-term investment, not for active trading. Procedure for withdrawal of SEPA mandate There are two different procedures. The first is the cancellation of the payment. It is made in the case when money is withdrawn for undelivered goods or services, or just want to refuse to pay for some reason. This can be done some time after the payment has been made, usually it seems to be four weeks, but it can be less or more, according to the contract. Cancellation of the payment is done through the bank, usually just go to the relevant section of online banking and click “Cancel” next to the selected payment. It is not necessary to contact the organization that requested the payment, but it will be useful to ask what the hell is going on. The mandate (reusable) does not stop working. The second is the withdrawal of the mandate. It is done through the organization you gave it to. The bank is not involved in this, it is not interested in it. Write a letter from the organization, saying, hiermit kündige ich mandate here with this Referenznummer. After that the organization has no right to withdraw money under this mandate anymore. The payments already made under the mandate are not cancelled. Sending money home TransferWise Very profitable service, at least for sending money to Ukraine. Sells euros at the market rate and sends. Has a low commission, I sent 100 euros, the commission was 2 euros. https://transferwise.com/u/igorp73 You can get 500 Euros for sending without any commission.",

    "content": "Freiberufler We have collected frequently asked questions and answers from our chat room on how to become a Freiberufler. Someone will find it useful to collect questions from @ilya.n @wowa @Ghedeon. I quit my job and decided to become a Freiberufler, where do I start? (I’ve already gone and told Arbeitsamt that I’m unemployed or haven’t gone yet.) The main thing is to understand what you want to do and how much you plan to get. You can look for a company while you’re thinking about it, find it to sign a contract and then go to the FA (step 1) - it takes 4 weeks. Preparing for the contract and looking for a customer are things you should also take officially as the beginning of your activity, for example: On March 1, you started looking for a contract, spent 1k on trips to Germany On March 10th, you found a contract, decided you could make 50k this year. On March 15, you signed a contract On March 20, you started working Further, if you submit the paper to the FA before March 28th, you can specify the start date of the activity on March 1st and the search costs (from March 1st to March 9th) can be deducted from the tax base. If you submit the paper after April 15, the FA in this example may be offended (signing a contract is always an activity) Here is a lot of information on registration In finance, how to fill in the registration. I did it myself and used the video from [youTube] (http://www.internet-einkommen.net/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung). You can contact a berater. Registration form [Fragebogen zur steuerlichen Erfassung] (https://www.formulare-bfinv.de/printout/034250.pdf) Gewerbe oder Freiberufler The main difference between Gewerbe and Freiberufler in the types of activities and education of the entrepreneur who will receive income. Gewerbe - Revenue from the sale of products (e.g., trading on ebay, advertising revenue, etc.) Freiberufler - consulting services to clients with specialized education. Registration Freiberufler is as simple as possible - the questionnaire for registration is filled in and refers to the FA. After ~5 weeks you will receive the cherished steueridentifikationsnummer and can bill customers. To register Gewerbe you need to go to the City Hall and fill out the registration application, pay the fee, and then give the completed questionnaire to the FA. Unlike Freiberufler, Guewerbe pays additional tax. Kleinunternehmer Provided that the income from business activities does not exceed the threshold of ~17k€ in the first year and ~50k€ in the following year, you can choose a simplified reporting option and the option not to submit a monthly VAT report to the FA. IMPORTANT: Finanzamt counts the calendar year. If you register with Kleinunternehmer in December, your income for the year cannot exceed 17500/12=1458 Eur. Take this into account when planning. The type of registration Freiberufler or Gewerbe does not affect the status of Kleinunternehmer. Pensions If you don’t owe the pension money, you don’t have to notify me if you have one customer so far, I would go to the pension office and talk about rule 5/6 (you don’t want it). Attention! Knowing all the things about who you have to do what is your responsibility if, for example, tomorrow SPD wins the election and passes the law that you have to pay the pension, then you have to decide for yourself. Specifically, the pension payment deadline is March of the following year. Health insurance The most correct option is to have insurance in place and stay on it. Insurance has no right to kick you out. If you stay insured and your wife is unemployed, she does not need to pay extra if she has worked, she will pay the same amount of insurance as before. Public, 15.7%. Private. About 300Eur. Depending on the state of health and age. If you are alone, you will probably want to get out of your insurance as soon as possible.

Tax class The tax class works on the same principle If you have received more of it and now as a selbstständig you also plan to receive more of it, you should leave the tax class as it is, if you are not scrapped, you can look for private insurance. The main problem with insurance is that it will take at least 400 euros a month it can’t be bypassed until you’re registered as a freiberuflich. and then if you get a lot of money, you’re still gonna have to pay up to 800 a month Arbeitsamt I’ve already gone and told the Arbatesamt I’m unemployed. If you don’t have a relationship with them, it’s a deep parallel to them, if there is, and they’re paying you money, we should go talk about Existenzgründer. The opportunity to continue receiving Arbeitslosgeld until you start your business. Conclusion of contracts. Let’s say I was offered a contract by a company. What should I pay attention to and can I conclude a contract without having anything (registration with Finanzamt, etc.)? We have freedom - yes, you can That you can’t just bill and get paid. You have to specify the tax number (the local number that changes when you move) (It is believed that it is possible to specify there already existing personal number (Steuer ID, which you received after registration in the FA. Not to be confused with the Identifikationsnummer, which is the default for everyone.) If you filed a declaration last year, but I wouldn’t) That’s why it is necessary to plan the letter/goods to FA two weeks before the invoice is issued At this point - see above - you have to understand how much money you plan to get This amount should be indicated in the form and based on it check the box saying that you will or will not take VAT (I recommend to make IstVersteurung). Option 3: 1) If you exceed 17.5k in the first year - you must collect VAT 2) you don’t have to and don’t collect VAT 3) you don’t have to, but you voluntarily collect VAT - it’s a little bit more profitable than option 2 on the cache When you started collecting VAT, you have to collect it and report it every month. The bank Bank - It is desirable to have a separate account, it will be much easier to report to the tax authorities. You can view services such as http://kontist.com (Not any separate service.

After a couple of months of staying in the new apartment you will receive a letter with documents and bank details to pay for the electricity. But since there are cheaper providers, it is recommended to change the provider from Vatenfall to another one. Can I be left without any electricity? No, the default provider will be automatically contracted. For Berlin this is Vatenfall I’ve got a letter of tariff change, what do I do? Change provider. The consumer has a special right to terminate the contract early if the tariff is changed by the provider How do I change my ISP? Choose a new provider, fill in the application online. They send the contract, sign and send it back. That’s all. The company contacts Vatenfall itself. Then you pay for the electricity to a new provider. A couple of popular providers in Berlin: http://e-wie-einfach.de Price: 28,90 ct/kWh + 100 € bonus for connection. http://simplygreen.de. Renewable energy provider. Price: 25,47 ct/kWh + 8€ mandatory monthly payment + gift bonus (large selection (bicycle, vacuum cleaner, etc.) full list here: https://www.simplygreen.de/praemien) For comparison, the price of the cheapest rate in Vattenfall is 26.28 Cent/kWh + 8.80 mandatory monthly payment + 120 € of different bonuses. To find a new provider you can use the search and comparison on [check24] (https://www.check24.de/strom/). How much does a family of two actually consume? This question may arise because on sites with tariff calculators, consumption is usually very high. For example, it is assumed that 3500 kWh is needed for two people, although 2000 kWh should be enough for an ordinary family What if I don’t have the kWh that I signed the contract for, what if I do the opposite? If the tariff is not a package one, there are no problems. In case of recalculation, which takes place once a year, or in case of termination, the difference will be returned or it will be necessary to pay additional at the normal cost, which is listed in the rate.",

All over Germany (including Berlin) Berlitz http://www.berlitz.de/en/ Some of the best courses, but at the same time one of the most expensive, about 700€ per block. Goethe Institut https://www.goethe.de/ins/de/en/kur.html Institute responsible for German language distribution in the world. The price is about 600€ per block. Deutsche Akademie http://www.deutschakademie.de/, 225 € per block VHS (Volkshochschule) - almost every city has its own website (http://www.berlin.de/vhs/, https://www.vhs.frankfurt.de). Small towns offer A1-B1 courses, rarely a B2 course. In large cities there are also B2, C1 - … There are intensive courses - 4 times a week, in the morning or in the evening. The price is about 150€ per block. Inlingua https://www.inlingua.de/en/, a global network of schools all over the world, many languages. Quality aids, good teachers and motivated groups. Only Berlin Kapitel Zwei http://kapitel-zwei.de/, 222 € per block Sprachsalon http://www.sprachsalon-berlin.de/en/, about 400€ per block Logo! http://www.logosprachenschule.de/ If you want to learn the language as quickly as possible, it is better to study the language intensively and in small groups. Often, even in small groups there is a “brake”, and if the teacher retells the material to him again, you will waste your time. It is better to change the group or school. Resisting the system is usually meaningless, often teachers are not inclined to change anything, and they are not going to get involved. But you can still get something for yourself as a compensation. As practice shows, it all depends on the specific teacher and the group of students who will study with you. Prices for intensity can vary very much, and the price is not an indicator of quality. There are a lot of schools, and if you don’t like the school, change it. To avoid spending money on books every time, you can often rent them directly from the school. Integration courses from BAMF (Ministry of Refugees and Displaced Persons) Previously, there was a practice of sending newcomers to compulsory or voluntary integration courses. The current practice is to send newcomers to compulsory or voluntary integration courses. time, because of the large number of refugees, you are likely to be refused, but you can try.

An application for a refund will be considered within a few months. Some feedback by school DAS Akademie. http://www.das-akademie.com/ Intensity A2-B1. Groups may not gain or assemble from what is available, respectively, in group B1 you can gain mixed A2-B1 levels. The teaching staff is not permanent, if the memory does not change, they have only a couple of teachers on the contract, all the other temporary and changing. If you get a “brake” in the group, you will all be braking together, and while he is told the things that he was supposed to learn at A1, everyone is waiting, and then part of the new material is skipped, because you have to keep up and go on schedule (but again, depends on the teacher). In general, the courses are not expensive, you can try, if you like and the group will be good, study. The main influx of students there in the summer. The main contingent of the school is students with all the ensuing ones. Anda http://www.anda-sprachschule.de/en/ 390 euros per month. Intensity B1-B2.1. Also in groups are mixed different levels. Some may read, others may not (and this is on B2). The payment policy is not very convenient: the more you take, the cheaper the cost of the month, but it may happen that the students in the group will change and you will not want to study there anymore. As in previous schools, the discipline is weak. Few people are preparing at home, so part of the time is wasted: checking homework and repeating the material. Some of the people in the group left Kapitel Zwei. Kapitel Zwei 220 euros per month. Intensity B1-B2.1. While there was a strong group, there was about. There was a teacher who led very well and clearly: did not wait for anyone, the material was read completely, the late did not wait. But the group quickly broke up (after the NG). The teacher changed and they started to get stupid. Like the previous schools, the same weak discipline, they walk - do not walk, are late, a couple of times someone even dragged a child. When asked why we were waiting for students who were always late, the teacher waved only in the air - it is clear that he was tired of it, but he did not want to read the material to one person. However, it is worth mentioning that after such indignation they allowed to attend free conversation courses (as compensation). In the groups, some of them are poorly read, and the wife had questions: did they have any tests before the recruitment process? To get rid of the “brakes”, we switched to C1 intensive. Now everything is fine: people talk well, are not late for classes, they prepare for classes. You can see that there are only those who have specific goals, and they are interested in the results. The effectiveness of training is clearly higher when a similar group is being recruited. The school also has a Telk exam preparation course + an opportunity to take the exam. The school’s curriculum itself intersects with the exam material. VHS Winter 2016-107 I went only in the evening, the groups are large, most of them are engaged because they were obliged to do it, the appropriate attitude to the lessons (the main thing is to come to check in), before the teachers were German, the latter were already Poles and Vietnamese, but cheaper you will not find anything. Contingent Syria, Afghanistan, those who are paid by the state. Neukölln seems to have a school where classes are only for women, such as Muslim women, who for various reasons cannot study in the same group as men. I went to Lichtenberg, which is a Vietnamese district, but the last time a Vietnamese man was only one, one girl from Kenya, but she quickly gave up. Here are the names of some of my classmates: Muhammad, Izmail, Noor, Halim, Hamid, Ali, Mustafa. I wrote about large groups there, it’s usually before B1 and usually at the beginning of the course, i.e. they recruit 15-18 people, by the middle of the course there are 9 people left, by the end of 6, and given that the courses are evening and the mark about their attendance takes place in the middle of the break, the part of the course leaves just after the mark, in the end up to the end of 3-4 people, in principle it’s comfortable, if you’re stubborn. It’s a bad thing that they walk through it once and then they let the material through in the end some trampling on the spot. By the way, there is a school at Baumschulenweg, I was there somehow, but they did not have evening courses then. In fact, no one wants to work with B1, it’s easier for teachers to work with A1, those who teach A1 and can’t really ask, and then come nerds like me on B1 and start to bake, and what differs schneiden from zuschneiden or anschalten from einschalten, and they can’t explain to Poles themselves.
